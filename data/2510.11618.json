These simulations offer a powerful tool for\nmodeling complex interactions between virtual agents, pro-\nviding a dynamic and context-rich environment for story\ngeneration. When humans write stories, they typically have\nan overarching mental picture of the story world. In our ap-\nproach, multi-agent simulations are used to create this over-\narching scene, where agents (i.e., the characters in the story)\ninteract based on predefined behaviors, triggering emergent\nevents that form the foundation of the story. This allows for\nthe automatic generation of diverse and engaging scenarios,\nwhich are crucial for building long-form stories.\nAs shown in Figure 1, the multi-agent sandbox simulation\nunfolds over time, with a series of events occurring within\nthe sandbox. These events arise from interactions between\n*Corresponding authors.\nThe Road Ahead:\nSurprises, Challenges, and Successes\nChapter 1\nThe Hidden Spark\nThe morning light filtered \nthrough the blinds, \ncasting fragmented \npatterns on John Smith’s \nkeyboard.

In\nthis process, agents act based on their predefined attributes,\nresponding to and influencing the world around them. The\ninteractions between agents and their environment give rise\nto a chain of events that continuously evolve, creating a dy-\nnamic storyline. The sandbox thus serves as a virtual space\nthat mirrors the mental scene a human writer might envision\nwhen crafting a story. It is within this evolving sandbox that\nthe foundations of the story are formed, from which a com-\nplete story can be generated based on the events that unfold.\nIn this setup, the sandbox serves a critical function: it is\nakin to the mental scene which a writer imagines, but with\nthe difference that the interactions and outcomes are auto-\nmatically generated through agent-based simulation rather\nthan purely through human imagination. Each interaction,\nwhether between characters or between characters and their\nsurroundings, adds new layers to the story. By allowing\nagents to operate in this evolving and flexible sandbox, we\nensure that the story’s events are not preordained but emerge\norganically from the agents’ behavior and environmental dy-\nnamics.\narXiv:2510.11618v1  [cs.CL]  13 Oct 2025\nTraditional story generation often follows a top-down\nmethod (Zhou et al. 2023; Wang et al. 2023; Fan, Lewis,\nand Dauphin 2019; Goldfarb-Tarrant et al. 2020; Yang et al.\n2022), where a story’s structure is outlined first and then ex-\npanded. Although this framework provides a guide, it can\nlimit natural character development and plot progression, re-\nsulting in stories that feel forced or predictable. In contrast,\nour hybrid bottom-up approach starts with agent-driven sim-\nulations that generate emergent events. As agents interact,\nthese events unfold naturally, enabling more organic charac-\nter growth and plot evolution, ultimately producing stories\nwith greater depth, coherence, and spontaneity.\nOur approach excels at generating longer, more detailed\nstories that stay consistent and cohesive. Using multi-agent\nsimulations, it creates diverse, meaningful events that enrich\nplot and characters. Our main contributions are:\n• A multi-agent simulation framework that generates dy-\nnamic and contextually rich story events through interac-\ntive agent behaviors.\n• A hybrid bottom-up process that combines emergent in-\nteractions with guided storytelling to enable natural char-\nacter development and plot progression.\n• The ability to produce coherent and consistent long-form\nstories exceeding 10,000 words, effectively overcoming\nlimitations of current story generation models.\nRelated Work\nLLM-Based Multi-Agent Simulation\nLLM-based multi-agent simulations have gained atten-\ntion for their advanced language processing and decision-\nmaking, enabling nuanced agent interactions (Jinxin et al.\n2023; Liu et al. 2023; Feng, Feng, and Qin 2023). These\nsystems have been explored in various domains (Wang et al.\n2024; Williams et al. 2023), particularly social simulation,\nwhich is most relevant to our research. Social simulation\nwith LLM-based agents provides an effective way to model\ncomplex societal dynamics that are otherwise difficult or\ncostly to study (Li, Yang, and Zhao 2023; Li et al. 2023). For\nexample, S3 (Gao et al. 2023) investigates the spread of in-\nformation, emotions, and attitudes in social networks, while\nGenerative Agents (Park et al. 2023) and AgentSims (Lin\net al. 2023) model daily human interactions in virtual towns.\nSocial Simulacra (Park et al. 2022) focuses on simulating\nonline community regulation, and SocialAI School (Kovaˇc\net al. 2023) uses LLMs to simulate child development. These\nstudies highlight the growing potential of LLM-based agents\nto offer valuable insights into societal behavior, community\nregulation, and social development, which provides a foun-\ndation for hybrid bottom-up long-form story generation.\nStory Generation\nStory generation has advanced with the rise of LLMs, which\nproduce fluent stories but often struggle with coherence and\nconsistency (Huot et al. 2024). To address these challenges,\nframeworks such as outlining followed by expansion into\nfull stories have been proposed (Zhou et al. 2023; Wang et al.\n2023). However, long-form story generation remains chal-\nlenging. Recent studies have explored multi-agent systems\nusing LLMs (Wang, Zhou, and Ledo 2024; Nasir, James, and\nTogelius 2024), such as Agents’ Room (Huot et al. 2024),\nwhich focuses on generating stories of 1,000-2,000 words\nusing Planning and Writing Agents coordinated by an Or-\nchestrator, and IBSEN (Han et al. 2024), which employs\nDirector-Actor agent collaboration for scriptwriting. While\ntop-down approaches, such as outlining, provide structure,\nthey limit natural storylines and character interactions. In\ncontrast, our hybrid bottom-up approach generates dynamic\nstories from simulations, producing richer and more coher-\nent stories of over 10,000 words, with clear advantages over\ntraditional methods.\nMethodology\nThis section introduces our long-form story generation sys-\ntem (Figure 2). It has two parts: a sandbox simulating multi-\nagent interactions to create events, and a Storyteller Agent\nthat turns these events into coherent, engaging stories.\nMulti-Agent Simulation\nThe multi-agent simulation serves as the foundation for gen-\nerating long-form stories. Both the process of long-form\nstory generation and standalone multi-agent simulation rely\non well-defined character settings. Inspired by the character\nmodeling approach of Generative Agents (Park et al. 2023),\nwe adopt and modify it to better suit the specific require-\nments of story generation. This modification ensures that the\ncharacters exhibit coherent behavior and contribute mean-\ningfully to the overall story structure.\nCore Attributes\nAs illustrated in Figure 2 “Persona\nScratch Information”, we first define the initial settings for\neach character. These initial settings are critical for the\nagents to engage in realistic interactions and generate com-\npelling events. Each character is defined by a set of core at-\ntributes, which include Name, Age, Innate, Learned, Cur-\nrently, and Lifestyle. These attributes describe both static\nand dynamic aspects of the character, providing a founda-\ntion for their behaviors and decisions. To model the char-\nacter’s daily actions, we introduce an additional attribute,\nDaily Plan Requirements. This attribute contains specific\ntasks or routines that the character plans to accomplish, such\nas conducting research, reading papers, etc. Importantly, this\nattribute is dynamic: at the start of a new day, a fresh set of\ndaily plans is generated. Based on these daily plan require-\nments, a detailed schedule is created, with tasks assigned to\nspecific hours of the day. This enables the character to fol-\nlow a structured routine, while leaving room for flexibility\nand variation.\nAbnormal Behavior Attribute\nTo add depth and excite-\nment to the generated stories, it is crucial to incorporate el-\nements that break from routine. A monotonous, predictable\ncharacter would lead to dull and uneventful stories. There-\nfore, we introduce an Abnormal Behavior attribute for each\ncharacter. This attribute determines whether the character is\nlikely to engage in actions that deviate from their usual be-\nhavior, such as abandoning their daily plan to pursue other\n[Name] John Smith\n[Age] 29\n[Innate] analytical, resilient, adaptable\n[Learned] John Smith is a seasoned software engineer with a \ndeep passion for natural language processing (NLP) ...\n[Currently] John Smith is a senior researcher at an AI innovation \nlab, where he focuses on developing cutting-edge NLP ...\n[Lifestyle] John Smith is an early riser, typically starting his day \nat 6am with a run.

The\nprobability of a character exhibiting abnormal behavior is\ncontrolled by a hyperparameter, the Abnormal Factor. A\nhigher value for this factor increases the likelihood that the\ncharacter will break from their routine and introduce more\ndynamic and unpredictable actions.\nCharacter Behavior Types\nCharacter behavior is catego-\nrized into three main types: move, chat, and none. The move\nbehavior indicates that the character physically moves to a\ndifferent location and performs specific actions. The chat\nbehavior represents the character engaging in conversations\nwith other characters. The none behavior means the charac-\nter does nothing, allowing for moments of reflection, rest, or\ninaction, which contribute to pacing and tension within the\nsimulation. These behaviors are selected based on the char-\nacter’s current attributes and the context of the simulation.\nTogether, these attributes define a character’s personality,\ndaily routines, and potential for unpredictability, creating a\nrich and dynamic environment for simulation. The agents\ninteract with each other based on these characteristics, gen-\nerating events that reflect plausible interpersonal dynamics\nand responses to environmental changes. This simulation\nframework serves as the raw material for long-form story\ngeneration, with the emergent events providing the founda-\ntion for compelling stories.\nEvent Recording\nIn the sandbox, every action performed\nby an agent is considered an event, as illustrated in Figure 2\nunder “Sandbox Events”. Each event is assigned a unique\nID within the sandbox, along with a defined start time and\nend time, allowing us to calculate its duration. Events can\ninvolve multiple participants; for example, a conversation\nevent will always have at least two participants. Addition-\nally, each event must be recorded with its location, a brief\ndescription of the event (referred to as description), and a\nmore detailed account (referred to as detail) to capture the\nfull context.\nThe description attribute provides a concise summary of\nthe event, such as “Starting coding on NLP models”, which\nbriefly explains what the event is about. However, this brief\ndescription is often insufficient for generating a rich and en-\ngaging story, as it lacks important contextual details. To ad-\ndress this, we introduce the detail attribute, which expands\nupon the basic description and includes additional informa-\ntion necessary for story generation. The detail attribute in-\ncorporates factors such as the environment, the time of day,\nthe status of the characters involved, and the location of the\nevent. Furthermore, it captures character-specific elements,\nincluding their actions, emotional states, and possible moti-\nvations during the event.\nBy providing these details, we ensure that the events\nwithin the sandbox are not just isolated actions, but are rich,\ncontextually grounded occurrences that can later be woven\ninto the story. This level of granularity allows the Storyteller\nAgent to craft stories that are nuanced and immersive, as the\nevents are not only linked to character behaviors but are also\ninformed by the surrounding context and dynamics.\nThrough this multi-agent simulation, we create a dynamic\nsandbox environment where interactions between characters\ngenerate a wide variety of events. These events, rich in con-\ntext and detail, form the core elements for story generation.\nThe Storyteller Agent then processes these events, trans-\nforming them into intricate, character-driven long-form sto-\nries that maintain both depth and coherence in the story.\nEnvironment Modeling\nThe environment plays a criti-\ncal role in the sandbox. In Generative Agents, the environ-\nment is modeled using a tile-based system, where tiles repre-\nsent the basic environmental units commonly found in RPG\ngames. However, this approach has inherent limitations, par-\nticularly the need for precise coordinates, which can make\nmodeling more rigid and less flexible. To overcome these\nlimitations, we adopt a more general tree-like structure for\nenvironment modeling, which does not rely on specific co-\nordinates but instead uses relative distances between objects\nand areas. For a detailed introduction to environment mod-\neling, please refer to supplementary material.\nUnlike the fixed, grid-based environment of Generative\nAgents, which confines agents to a limited simulation space,\nour model enables a virtually limitless environment. This\nmeans that the sandbox can be as large and complex as\nneeded, without the constraint of pre-defined spatial bound-\naries. Characters can explore a more expansive and immer-\nsive world, interacting with a wider range of objects and ar-\neas, making the simulation more dynamic and fluid.\nHybrid Bottom-Up Long-Form Story Generation\nOnce the events generated through the multi-agent sandbox\nsimulation are available, the next step is to use the Story-\nteller Agent to generate the long-form story. As illustrated\nin Figure 3, this process follows a structured workflow that\nincorporates several key stages.\nEvent Summarization\nThe sandbox events are arranged\nchronologically, but the sheer number of events can be over-\nwhelming. Directly feeding all these events into a LLM\nis not feasible due to the limitations of the model’s con-\ntext window. Therefore, summarization is necessary. First,\nwe summarize the events by character, recording what each\ncharacter did on each day. This summary is also arranged\nchronologically. Once we have these character-based daily\nsummaries, we introduce a dynamic windowing mechanism\nthat groups events into smaller chunks for summarization.\nThe size of the dynamic window is automatically determined\nby the LLM, allowing for adaptability to the complexity and\ndensity of the events. The summaries within each window\nare abstract and condensed, reducing the volume of data\nwhile maintaining chronological order. This layered and dy-\nnamic approach ensures that the event data remains manage-\nable for the LLM while preserving key information.\nStory Information Generation\nIn the story generation\nprocess, we first generate the story type (e.g., adventure,\nmystery, romance) rather than beginning with the title. The\nstory type plays a crucial role in shaping the story, as it\nprovides a foundational framework that guides the subse-\nquent development of the plot, characters, and themes. By\ndetermining the story type at the outset, we establish a clear\ndirection for the story, ensuring coherence and consistency\nthroughout the story’s progression.\nAfter determining the story type, we generate the story\ntitle beginning with the initial event summary. The title is\niteratively refined with each new event summary, allowing\nthe model to update the title dynamically based on evolving\ncontext. This process not only produces a cohesive and rel-\nevant title but also acts as a filter, highlighting key elements\nand capturing the story’s essence. The language model de-\ncides whether to retain or modify the title depending on the\ncurrent event summaries.\nOnce the title is finalized, a secondary selection process\nidentifies the most suitable title. This can involve using a\nlanguage model for evaluation, manual review, or training\na dedicated model. Due to the lack of a specialized dataset,\nwe opt for a fully automated LLM-based approach that ranks\ntitles based on relevance, creativity, and coherence with the\nevent summaries.\nFollowing title generation, other key story information is\nproduced, including background, main themes, chapter ti-\ntles, conflicts per chapter, and major plot points. These ele-\nments are informed by the story type, title, and prior event\nsummaries, ensuring a well-structured and thematically con-\nsistent story.\nIf manual inputs are provided, the Storyteller Agent skips\nautomatic generation of these elements. Additionally, hyper-\nparameters like the number of themes, chapters, conflicts per\nchapter, and plot points per chapter allow customization of\nthe story’s scope and depth.\nStory Generation\nOnce the story information is ready, the\nactual story generation process begins. A key component in\nthis stage is the information retrieval module, which receives\ntwo types of input data: story-related information (such as ti-\ntle, themes, and chapter details) and sandbox data (including\ncharacter information, environment details, and the events\nthemselves). To further enhance event matching for informa-\ntion retrieval, we convert events into event embeddings us-\ning an embedding model. This allows events to be retrieved\nboth through keyword-based search and dense vector-based\nretrieval.\nIt is important to highlight that the process of information\nretrieval and its application in story generation is inherently\nbottom-up in nature. This is because the events from the\nsandbox, which play a crucial role in the generation process,\nare drawn upon, distinguishing this approach from tradi-\ntional top-down story generation methods. Furthermore, this\ninformation retrieval process also acts as a dynamic filtering\nmechanism, automatically selecting meaningful events that\nalign with the story’s progression. By continuously refining\nthe event selection based on the evolving story, the system\nensures that only the most relevant and engaging content is\n[Start Time] 2024-09-01 9:00 AM\n[Participants] John Smith\n[Description] Starting coding on \nNLP models\n[Detail] ...\n...\n[Start Time] 2024-09-01 6:30 PM\n[Participants] John Smith\n[Description] Having dinner at a \nlocal restaurant\n[Detail] ...\n...\n[Start Time] 2024-09-02 11:30 AM  \n[Participants] John Smith  \n[Description] Reading research \npapers on NLP  \n[Detail] ... \n...\n[Start Time] 2024-09-01 10:00 AM\n[Participants] Emily Wilson\n[Description] Attending a machine \nlearning class\n[Detail] ...\n...\n[Start Time] 2024-09-01 7:00 PM\n[Participants] Emily Wilson\n[Description] Joining a group \nstudy session\n[Detail] ...\n...\nAdvancing Knowledge:\nA Journey Through NLP \nand Machine Learning\nCollaborative Innovation: \nAdvancing Projects and \nLearning Together\nStrategic Growth:\nLeading, Creating, and \nInnovating Together\nThe Road Ahead: \nSurprises, Challenges,\nand Successes\nThe Road Ahead:\nSurprises, Challenges,\nand Successes\nThe Road Ahead:\nSurprises, Challenges,\nand Successes\nTitle\nAdventure / Mystery / \nRomance / Fantasy / \nThriller / ...\nType\nBackground\nThemes\nChapter Titles\nConflicts\nin Chapters\nPlot Points\nin Chapters\nChapter i\nChapter\nSummary\nChapter\nSummary\nHistory\nInformation Retrieval\n2024-09-01\nJohn Smith\nJohn Smith kicked off the day by diving \ninto coding on NLP models, making \nsignificant progress and ...\nEmily Wilson\nEmily Wilson spent her morning \nfocused on expanding her knowledge \nin a machine learning class ...\n2024-09-02\nJohn Smith\nJohn Smith spent his late morning \nimmersed in reading research papers \non NLP, gaining deeper insights ...\nOn September 1st, John Smith made \nsignificant progress coding on NLP \nmodels, while Emily Wilson spent her \nmorning expanding her knowledge in a \nmachine learning class.

This hybrid bottom-up method allows for the gener-\nation of long, coherent stories, where each chapter builds on\nthe events and summaries that have come before, ensuring\ncontinuity and story flow.\nExperiments\nIn this section, we present experiments to validate the effec-\ntiveness of StoryBox, including evaluation metrics, baseline\ncomparisons, and result analysis.\nExperimental Settings\nDataset\nFollowing the setup described in DOC (Yang\net al. 2023), we use premises, settings, and characters as in-\nputs. However, the DOC dataset contains relatively homoge-\nneous story types, so we constructed a new dataset consist-\ning of 20 story-related settings without reference answers.\nOur dataset features a broader variety of story types, in-\ncluding genres such as science fiction. Detailed information\nabout our dataset can be found in the supplementary mate-\nrial.\nEvaluation Metrics\nEvaluating generated stories is inher-\nently challenging due to the subjective, multi-dimensional,\nand context-dependent nature of narrative quality (Guan and\nHuang 2020; Chhun et al. 2022; Yang and Jin 2024). In-\nspired by recent advances such as Agents’ Room (Huot et al.\n2024), we adopt a hybrid evaluation strategy that combines\nboth human and automated methods to provide a compre-\nhensive assessment of story quality. Building upon this foun-\ndation, we expand the evaluation criteria to better suit the\nstory generation setting.\n(1) Human Evaluation\nWe conduct structured pairwise\ncomparisons across six criteria: Plot, Creativity, Character\nDevelopment, Language Use, Conflict Quality, and Over-\nall. These dimensions cover key aspects of long-form story-\ntelling, including narrative coherence, originality, emotional\ndepth, and stylistic quality. Annotators with backgrounds in\nliterature, storytelling, and related fields compare story pairs\nfrom the same setting and provide ratings for each dimen-\nsion as well as an overall preference. To reduce fatigue and\nbias, each annotator evaluates a limited number of pairs per\nsession. We apply a Latin Square design to balance the as-\nsignment of story settings and randomize story order. For\neach setting, we collect M × N × (N −1)/2 comparisons,\nwhere M is the number of settings and N the number of\nmethods.\n(2) Automatic Evaluation\nWe also use a large language\nmodel to perform evaluations based on the same crite-\nria as human judgments.

We also include the sandbox-specific metric Character Behavior Consis-\ntency, along with the Average Word Count for each method.\ntured prompts aligned with human instructions and com-\npares story pairs across key dimensions. This approach of-\nfers a cost-effective approximation of human evaluation and\nallows us to assess its alignment with human ratings. In addi-\ntion, we include a sandbox-specific metric, Character Be-\nhavior Consistency, which evaluates how well characters\nact in line with their defined personas. We also report Aver-\nage Word Count to reflect story length.\nFull metric definitions, evaluation procedures, and inter-\nface details can be found in the supplementary material.\nBaselines\nWe selected several high-performing open-\nsource methods that can be reliably reproduced as our base-\nlines. We categorize the baseline methods into three types:\n(1) Vanilla LLMs: methods that generate long-form stories\ndirectly using large language models, such as GPT-4o (Hurst\net al. 2024) and DeepSeek-V3 (Liu et al. 2024); (2) Struc-\ntured Frameworks: methods that utilize structured frame-\nworks for long-form story generation based on LLMs, such\nas Re3 (Yang et al. 2022) and DOC-V2 (Yang et al. 2023);\nand (3) Multi-Agent Simulations: methods that generate\nthrough multi-agent simulations, such as IBSEN (Han et al.\n2024).\nImplementation Details\nThe process of implementing the\nsystem, including the story-related settings, sandbox initial-\nization, and the setup of characters and environment, is de-\nscribed in the supplementary material. The specific prompts\nused in this paper, along with additional implementation de-\ntails, are also provided therein.\nAutomatic Evaluation\nWe conduct an automatic evaluation of several methods,\nwith results shown in Figure 4(a). StoryBox consistently\nachieves the best performance across all major metrics.\nFor the Plot metric, it maintains strong coherence, while\nIBSEN performs less well, likely due to its lack of narrative-\nspecific design. Most models show similar results in Cre-\nativity, except DeepSeek-V3, which performs noticeably\nworse, suggesting limited stylistic diversity. In Character\nDevelopment, StoryBox ranks highest, and IBSEN follows,\nindicating that sandbox-based simulations are effective in\nmodeling character dynamics. StoryBox also leads in Lan-\nguage Use, thanks to the Storyteller Agent’s integration of\nenvironmental and contextual cues, which enriches the nar-\nrative with vivid descriptions. For Conflict Quality, it per-\nforms best, reflecting its ability to construct structured and\nengaging tension. The Overall score confirms StoryBox’s\nstrong and balanced performance across dimensions. In the\nsandbox-specific Character Behavior Consistency metric,\nStoryBox slightly outperforms IBSEN, suggesting that sim-\nulation contributes to coherent agent behavior. Finally, in the\nAverage Word Count metric, which reflects long-form gen-\neration ability, StoryBox produces stories averaging around\n12,000 words. Other long-form methods typically generate\nabout 10,000 words, while models without such adaptation\nproduce much shorter texts, averaging only around 1,000\nwords, revealing a clear limitation in generating extended\nstory.\nAdditional results, including case studies, are provided in\nthe supplementary material.\nHuman Evaluation\nGiven the inherently subjective nature of story generation,\nhuman evaluation is essential for a comprehensive assess-\nment. To capture diverse reader perspectives, we recruited\n78 participants from a variety of academic backgrounds, in-\ncluding literature, computer science, and other disciplines.\nEach participant was asked to compare pairs of stories gen-\nplot\ncreativity\nchar. dev.\nlang. use\nconflict qual.\noverall\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n1.5\n2.0\n2.5\nStrength\nSimulation Study\n1 Day\n3 Days\n7 Days\n14 Days\n30 Days\nFigure 5: Effect of simulation duration on story generation\nperformance.\nerated from the same setting, based on the same set of di-\nmensions used in the automatic evaluation.\nThe human evaluation results are presented in Figure 4(b).\nOverall, StoryBox consistently achieves the highest scores\nacross all dimensions, indicating strong performance in both\nstructural and stylistic aspects of storytelling. This further\nconfirms the effectiveness of the system across a range of\nreader expectations. Compared to the automatic evaluation\nresults in Figure 4(a), the trends are largely aligned, sug-\ngesting that automatic metrics provide a reasonably accurate\nreflection of human judgments. Nonetheless, some discrep-\nancies are observed, as human evaluators show a stronger\npreference for IBSEN over GPT-4o and DeepSeek-V3. This\nhighlights the possibility that simulation-based narratives\nmay offer human-relatable qualities that are not fully cap-\ntured by automated metrics.\nSimulation Duration Study\nWe investigate how varying simulation durations (1, 3, 7, 14,\nand 30 days) affect story quality, while keeping story length\nfixed at around 12,000 words. As shown in Figure 5, not all\nmetrics benefit equally from longer simulations.\nPlot, Creativity, and Language Use show minimal varia-\ntion across durations, likely due to the strong guidance of the\nStoryteller Agent and the language model’s inherent capa-\nbilities. In contrast, Character Development and Conflict\nQuality improve with longer simulations, as extended inter-\nactions allow for deeper character arcs and more complex\ntensions. The Overall metric improves significantly from\n1 to 7 days, but shows diminishing returns beyond that.\nNotably, token usage roughly doubles with each duration\nincrease, while quality gains plateau. Excessive events in\nlonger simulations may even burden the model’s ability to\nsynthesize information effectively.\nOverall, a 7-day simulation strikes a practical balance be-\ntween quality and efficiency, making it a suitable default un-\nder current model constraints.\nAblation Study\nWe conduct an ablation study to assess the impact of three\ncomponents: (1) object descriptions, (2) random abnormal\nplot\ncreativity\nchar. dev.\nlang. use\nconflict qual.\noverall\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\nStrength\nAblation Study\nStoryBox (Ours)\nw/o Object Description\nw/o Abnormal Behavior\nw/o Dynamic Window\nFigure 6: Performance comparison of StoryBox without dif-\nferent components.\nbehaviors, and the (3) dynamic context window. As shown\nin Figure 6, removing any component leads to a performance\ndrop, though to varying degrees.\nExcluding object descriptions harms Language Use, as\nenvironmental details help the Storyteller Agent produce\nricher and more grounded narratives. Removing random\nabnormal behaviors causes the sharpest decline, particu-\nlarly in Creativity, Character Development, and Conflict\nQuality, highlighting the importance of unpredictability in\ndriving dynamic stories. Disabling the dynamic context\nwindow reduces Plot quality, as it limits the model’s ability\nto maintain coherence across longer narrative arcs. Overall,\neach component plays a distinct role, and their combination\nis key to StoryBox’s effectiveness.\nLimitations\nWhile our multi-agent sandbox-based approach shows\nstrong potential, it still has limitations. First, the simulation\ncurrently proceeds sequentially, with each character acting\none at a time, which slows down the overall process. Paral-\nlelizing the simulation could improve efficiency, but manag-\ning interdependent character behaviors remains a challenge.\nFor instance, one character’s actions may directly affect oth-\ners, and naive parallelization could introduce inconsisten-\ncies. Second, evaluating story quality is still a difficult prob-\nlem. Although we use both human and automatic evalua-\ntions, human judgment is costly and time-consuming. More\naccurate and scalable automated metrics are needed to better\napproximate human preferences and enable broader applica-\ntion. These issues represent important directions for future\nwork.\nConclusion\nIn this paper, we introduced StoryBox, a novel approach for\nlong-form story generation using multi-agent simulations.\nOur experiments show that StoryBox outperforms existing\nmethods on many metrics. Despite challenges in evaluating\nstory quality, both automatic and human evaluations confirm\nits effectiveness in generating engaging and coherent stories.\nFuture work will focus on refining the sandbox environment\nand exploring additional story-driven applications.\nReferences\nChen, J.; Hu, X.; Liu, S.; Huang, S.; Tu, W.-W.; He, Z.;\nand Wen, L. 2024.

At the\nfinal level, Object, each element includes a description to\ncapture its unique characteristics and role within the envi-\nronment. Additionally, every level in this hierarchy can be\nassigned a description, although, for simplicity, we omit the\ndescription attributes for all levels except Object in the fig-\nure.\nThis hierarchical structure allows characters to perceive\ntheir environment in a flexible and context-sensitive man-\nner. Each character can be aware of their current location\nas well as the objects and features within that location. By\nmodeling the environment this way, we create a more dy-\nnamic, expansive setting for agent interactions. The environ-\nment can scale beyond the limitations imposed by tile-based\nsystems, which typically constrain the modeling to a limited\nsimulated space, as seen in Generative Agents. This tree-like\nmodel offers flexibility, allowing for a larger, more detailed\nenvironment that adapts to the unfolding story.\nDataset Details\nTable 1 presents a collection of 20 stories, each defined by\na premise, setting, and characters. Each story includes the\nfollowing key elements:\n• Premise: It provides a concise description of the story’s\ncore plot, setting the stage for the reader to understand\nthe main story. This section typically outlines the primary\nevent or challenge in the story, whether it’s an adventure,\na mystery, or a personal transformation. The premise in-\ntroduces the main conflict or task that the protagonist\nmust address, giving the story its driving force.\n• Setting: It describes the time, place, and environment in\nwhich the story takes place. Settings can vary widely,\nfrom futuristic cities to ancient ruins, from dystopian so-\ncieties to magical realms. The setting plays an important\nrole in shaping the story, influencing the characters’ ac-\ntions and the overall tone of the story.\n• Characters: The characters section lists the key players\nin each story, providing brief descriptions of their back-\ngrounds. The characters are the driving force of the plot,\nand their development is crucial to the unfolding of the\nstory. Each character’s traits, relationships, and actions\ncontribute to the story’s progression and the resolution of\nthe conflict. By understanding the characters’ roles, read-\ners can gain insight into the emotional depth and thematic\nelements of the story.\nStory 1\n[Premise]\nAfter a strange phenomenon causes time to freeze

A well-executed plot presents\na clearly defined beginning, middle, and end, with events\nthat unfold in a logical and engaging sequence. Strong\nplots maintain a clear narrative direction through well-\npaced turning points and developments that align with\nthe story’s themes and internal logic. Avoidance of plot\nholes, abrupt transitions, or confusing sequences further\ncontributes to the clarity and momentum of the story.\n• Creativity: This metric measures the originality and\nimaginative strength of the narrative. A creative story in-\ntroduces fresh ideas, vivid characters, and emotionally\nresonant themes while steering clear of clich´es, stereo-\ntypes, and formulaic tropes. The ability to craft a distinc-\ntive world and storyline without leaning heavily on the\nprompt reflects strong creative intent. When characters,\nevents, and settings feel unexpected yet meaningful, the\nstory gains a sense of uniqueness and depth.\n• Character\nDevelopment:\nThis\nmetric\nevaluates\nthe depth and progression of characters within the\nstory. Strong character development features multi-\ndimensional individuals whose motivations, behaviors,\nand decisions are clearly defined and remain consistent\nwith their established personas. Characters who exhibit\nnoticeable growth, transformation, or internal struggle\nacross the narrative demonstrate a compelling arc that\nenhances emotional resonance. Rich backstories and\nemotional complexity further reinforce the believability\nand depth of the characters, making them more engaging\nand authentic.\n• Language Use: This metric evaluates the richness, pre-\ncision, and stylistic impact of the language. Effective lan-\nguage use is marked by varied sentence structures, pur-\nposeful word choices, and the use of literary devices such\nas metaphor, imagery, and descriptive detail to enhance\ntone and atmosphere. Strong narratives employ language\nto vividly portray settings, immersing the reader in the\nphysical and emotional landscape of the story. A com-\npelling narrative voice avoids repetition or flat expres-\nsion, using language as a tool to deepen characterization\nand sustain reader engagement.\n• Conflict Quality: This metric assesses the presence, in-\ntensity, and narrative function of conflict within the story.\nHigh-quality conflict drives the plot forward, deepens\ncharacter arcs, and highlights thematic elements through\nmeaningful tension and stakes. Effective conflict is not\nonly believable and engaging, but also complex in its\nemotional or moral dimensions, providing opportunities\nfor growth, confrontation, and resolution. The way con-\nflict shapes the overall trajectory of the narrative reflects\nthe story’s structural and emotional depth.\nAutomatic Evaluation Metrics\nOur automatic evaluation metrics consist of two compo-\nnents. First, we adopt the same dimensions used in human\nevaluation, but apply them through structured assessments\nconducted by a large language model. This enables a sys-\ntematic and efficient approximation of human judgments.\nSecond, we extend the evaluation with additional metrics\ntailored to our task. In particular, we introduce a specialized\nmetric for multi-agent simulation-based storytelling, which\nwe call Character Behavior Consistency, as well as a simple\nstatistical indicator, Average Word Count, which provides\ninsight into the overall story length. The detailed definitions\nare as follows:\n• Character Behavior Consistency: A specialized metric\nfor multi-agent simulation-based story generation, this\nmeasures whether characters’ actions align with their\npredefined persona settings (”Persona Scratch Informa-\ntion”). Characters should act consistently with their at-\ntributes, goals, and motivations, ensuring believability\nand coherence in the story.\n• Average Word Count: This metric calculates the aver-\nage number of words per generated story. While basic,\nit provides an indication of the story’s overall length,\nwhich is crucial in long-form generation. Longer stories\ntypically allow for more extensive character development\nand greater plot complexity.\nHuman Evaluation Details\nTo facilitate consistent and efficient story evaluation, we de-\nveloped a custom web-based platform tailored to the needs\nof our human evaluation task. An overview of the platform\ninterface is shown in Figure 8. To accommodate a diverse\ngroup of annotators, the platform supports both Chinese and\nEnglish language modes. Access to the system is restricted\nto verified annotators, who must log in before participating\nin the evaluation process to ensure traceability and avoid du-\nplicate submissions.\nEach evaluation instance is based on a specific story set-\nting, under which two stories generated by different methods\nare presented as Story A and Story B. For each story, the in-\nterface displays the complete text along with the word count,\nenabling annotators to consider both narrative content and\noverall length. Annotators can switch between Story A and\nStory B using the controls on the right-hand panel, where\nthey can also view detailed explanations of the evaluation\ncriteria. For each criterion, annotators are asked to indicate\nwhich story they prefer, or to mark them as equivalent if no\npreference can be determined. Once all selections are made,\nthe annotator submits the evaluation and is presented with\nthe next story pair. The backend system maintains a record\nof which story pairs have been evaluated by each annotator,\nthereby preventing duplicate evaluations.\nAutomatic Evaluation Details\nTo conduct automatic evaluation, we follow a prompting\nstrategy similar to that used in Agents’ Room, with carefully\nstructured templates that guide the model to emulate human\nStory Setting\nPremise:After a strange phenomenon causes time to freeze for everyone except for a small group of individuals, a young scientist\nnamed Claire must find a way to reverse the event before she loses her sanity.\nSetting:The story takes place in a modern-day city that has suddenly fallen into an eerie state of paralysis, with the world frozen in\nplace.\nCharacters:\nClaire Matthews: A brilliant but socially awkward physicist in her early 30s.\nDr. Harold Reed: An older scientist and Claire's mentor.\nTommy Harris: A troubled teenager who sees the event as a chance to escape his problems.\nSophia Lutz: A police officer trying to maintain order in the chaos.\nChris Tanaka: A tech expert who believes the phenomenon is a computer glitch.\nMaya Harrison: A woman who was in the middle of an argument with her partner when time froze.\n[Story A] Word count: 10892\nFrozen Moments\n**Chapter 1**\nThe hum of the laboratory was punctuated by the faint sound of whirring machines and the soft rustle of papers. Claire Matthews leaned \nover her workstation, her brow furrowed in concentration as she meticulously adjusted the settings on the particle accelerator. The \nfluorescent lights flickered above, casting an almost surreal glow over the chaotic landscape of beakers, wires, and advanced \ntechnology. As a brilliant but socially awkward physicist, Claire found solace in her experiments—her world simplified to equations \nand lab results.\nToday’s experiment was crucial; it aimed to measure quantum fluctuations in real-time. With every dial she turned and every data point \nshe logged, she felt a thrill ripple through her veins—a mixture of excitement and anxiety that had become all too familiar. She was \non the brink of a breakthrough when suddenly, a strange sensation swept through her. It was as if reality itself hit pause.\nThe low whirring stopped abruptly. The lights flickered once before stabilizing into an unsettling stillness. Claire blinked hard, \nshaking her head as if to clear it from a dream. She looked around—and froze. The world around her had turned to a tableau, every \ndetail frozen in time. The machines, usually alive with motion and sound, stood silent, their lights dimmed. Claire’s heart raced as \nshe took in the scene: her colleagues caught mid-conversation, one gesturing dramatically; a lab assistant halfway through pouring a \nchemical into a beaker; even the digital screens flickered with still images of ongoing data feeds.\nInstinctively, Claire moved away from her workstation and stepped towards the door, her mind racing with scientific questions. Could \nthis be some unforeseen side effect of her experiment? Had she unintentionally created a temporal anomaly? She needed answers—now more \nthan ever.\nAs she navigated through the frozen chaos, Claire noticed that she wasn’t alone. Beyond the confines of her laboratory, figures \nemerged from other areas of the facility: an older scientist who had been Claire’s mentor for years stood nearby, his expression one \nof disbelief as he stared at his watch, seemingly checking for time that no longer moved. A tech expert known for his skepticism about \neverything outside of computer codes leaned against a wall, brow furrowed as if attempting to debug an urgent glitch he couldn’t quite \nwrap his head around. In the corner, Claire spotted a teenager she recognized from the community center, his face a mask of \nfrustration and confusion. He had been attending sessions on science and technology, but now he stood frozen in time, caught mid-sigh \nas if the weight of his worries had become too much to bear. As she moved closer, Claire could see the faint shimmer of tears in his \neyes—an expression that echoed her own panic.\nThen there was a woman just outside the lab, her voice silenced mid-argument with a partner who remained unseen. Their confrontation \nhad been palpable moments ago; now it hung in the air like an unfinished symphony. Claire felt an odd connection to this woman—a \nshared sense of being trapped in circumstances beyond their control.\nFinally, nearby was Officer Reynolds, a police officer charged with maintaining order throughout the facility. His hand rested on his \nholstered weapon, tension radiating from his posture as he appeared caught between duty and disbelief.\nClaire’s mind buzzed with possibilities as she took stock of her surroundings. The anomaly had clearly affected more than just her \nexperiment; it was a widespread phenomenon that transcended her laboratory walls. An uneasy stillness enveloped the lab, each \nheartbeat echoing in Claire's ears. Time had become a strange, palpable entity—one she could almost reach out and touch. The \nrealization sent shivers down her spine; this was no ordinary malfunction of her particle accelerator. It felt like more than just a \nscientific anomaly—it was a moment suspended in the fabric of reality itself.\nShe stepped closer to the frozen teenager, whose name she recalled as Lucas, and knelt beside him. Claire had seen him struggling with \nthe challenges of adolescence during their sessions at the community center. His passion for science was overshadowed by his turbulent \nhome life, and she often wished she could reach out further to help him. Now he stood trapped, his anguish solidified in time, and \nClaire found herself wrestling with a sudden surge of responsibility. If she could somehow find a way to free them all from this \nmoment—this purgatory—would it give him another chance?\nClaire stood up abruptly, scanning the lab for any signs of movement or clues that might indicate what had gone wrong. The soft hum of \nthe particle accelerator now rendered silent felt like an ominous reminder of her experiment gone awry. As she moved through the lab, \nthe scene around her appeared both haunting and surreal. Dr. Harold Reed stood frozen near his desk, brows furrowed in concentration \nas he peered at a glowing monitor displaying data that was now stuck on a single frame. Claire had always respected his intellect and \ninsight, but seeing him like this—suspended in time—was disconcerting. She knew he would be just as bewildered by their current \npredicament.\n\"Dr. Harold Reed?\" she called out, though she knew he couldn't hear her. The emptiness of the lab pressed against her, amplifying her \nsense of isolation. She took a deep breath, willing herself to stay calm despite the chaos swirling in her mind.\nSuddenly, she spotted the tech expert, Marcus, standing rigidly at his workstation with an expression of disbelief plastered on his \nface. His fingers were poised above his keyboard as if he'd been caught mid-typing during a frantic attempt to diagnose whatever \nglitch had caused this event. Claire had often found him abrasive and dismissive of theoretical physics in favor of practical \ntechnology—but now there was no denying that they needed each other’s expertise.\nPickMan\n中文/\nEnglish\nLog out\nDisplay Switch\nShow A\nShow B\nMetric Info\nPlot\nA\nSame\nB\nCreativity\nA\nSame\nB\nCharacter Development\nA\nSame\nB\nLanguage Use\nA\nSame\nB\nConflict Quality\nA\nSame\nB\nSubmit\nNext one\nFigure 8: Overview of the human evaluation system.\nannotation. An example of the prompt template used in our\nevaluation is shown in Table 2. The prompt includes detailed\ndefinitions of the five evaluation dimensions to ensure con-\nsistency with human evaluation standards. The LLM is in-\nstructed to assess each story pair along these dimensions and\nprovide a final preference for each, enabling us to systemat-\nically collect model-based judgments that are directly com-\nparable to human annotations.\nIn addition to standard qualitative metrics, we further\nevaluate the Character Behavior Consistency of stories gen-\nerated under the multi-agent simulation framework. This\nmetric is specifically designed to assess whether characters\nact in accordance with their predefined persona attributes,\nreferred to as the Identity Stable Set (ISS). To facilitate this\nevaluation, we construct a prompt that guides the LLM to\nanalyze each character’s actions, decisions, and dialogue for\nalignment with their ISS, as shown in Table 3. The model\nis asked to rate consistency on a 0–10 scale, based on align-\nment, believability, and absence of contradictions.\nFor the statistical metric Average Word Count, we com-\npute the average number of words per story by simply split-\nting text based on whitespace.\nSandbox Initialization\nBuilding a sandbox based on a multi-agent simulation re-\nquires proper initialization. The initialization process relies\non the relevant settings from the dataset’s stories, including\nthe setup of sandbox characters and the sandbox environ-\nment. In this section, we provide an example of how the\nsandbox is initialized based on the story settings from the\ndataset. This example is taken from “Story 1” in Table 1.\nThe sandbox initialization for all stories can be found in our\nproject.\nCharacter Setup\nThe setup of sandbox characters is derived from the under-\nstanding of the relevant story settings. It primarily involves\nestablishing the “Persona Scratch Information”, as outlined\nin Figure 2, which includes details such as names, ages,\nand other relevant information. Based on the description in\n“Story 1”, we utilized GPT-4o mini to generate the cor-\nresponding character setups, as shown in Table 4. The same\napproach is applied to other stories.\nEnvironment Setup\nThe sandbox environment setup is similarly based on the\nunderstanding of the relevant story settings. The goal is to\nconstruct an environment with hierarchical relationships, as\ndepicted in Figure 7. In this case, drawing from the details\nin “Story 1”, we used GPT-4o mini to generate the cor-\nresponding environment setup in the form of a YAML file,\nas shown in Table 5. This method is also applied to other\nstories in the dataset.\nYou will conduct a side-by-side evaluation. You will be given two system-generated stories.\nYour task is to compare the two stories and determine which one is better based on the\nfollowing dimensions:\nPlot: This metric evaluates the structural integrity and coherence of the narrative. A\nwell-executed plot presents a clearly defined beginning, middle, and end, with events\nthat unfold in a logical and engaging sequence. Strong plots maintain a clear narrative\ndirection through well-paced turning points and developments that align with the story’s\nthemes and internal logic. Avoidance of plot holes, abrupt transitions, or confusing\nsequences further contributes to the clarity and momentum of the story.\nCreativity: This metric measures the originality and imaginative strength of the narrative.\nA creative story introduces fresh ideas, vivid characters, and emotionally resonant themes\nwhile steering clear of clich´es, stereotypes, and formulaic tropes. The ability to craft\na distinctive world and storyline without leaning heavily on the prompt reflects strong\ncreative intent. When characters, events, and settings feel unexpected yet meaningful, the\nstory gains a sense of uniqueness and depth.\nCharacter Development: This metric evaluates the depth and progression of characters\nwithin the story. Strong character development features multi-dimensional individuals\nwhose motivations, behaviors, and decisions are clearly defined and remain consistent with\ntheir established personas. Characters who exhibit noticeable growth, transformation, or\ninternal struggle across the narrative demonstrate a compelling arc that enhances emotional\nresonance. Rich backstories and emotional complexity further reinforce the believability\nand depth of the characters, making them more engaging and authentic.\nLanguage Use: This metric evaluates the richness, precision, and stylistic impact of the\nlanguage. Effective language use is marked by varied sentence structures, purposeful word\nchoices, and the use of literary devices such as metaphor, imagery, and descriptive detail\nto enhance tone and atmosphere. Strong narratives employ language to vividly portray\nsettings, immersing the reader in the physical and emotional landscape of the story. A\ncompelling narrative voice avoids repetition or flat expression, using language as a tool\nto deepen characterization and sustain reader engagement.\nConflict Quality: This metric assesses the presence, intensity, and narrative function of\nconflict within the story. High-quality conflict drives the plot forward, deepens character\narcs, and highlights thematic elements through meaningful tension and stakes. Effective\nconflict is not only believable and engaging, but also complex in its emotional or moral\ndimensions, providing opportunities for growth, confrontation, and resolution. The way\nconflict shapes the overall trajectory of the narrative reflects the story’s structural\nand emotional depth.\nProvide a detailed assessment of the two stories in terms of these five dimensions.\nConclude your assessment with scores for each dimension using the template below. Do not\nadd any emphasis, such as bold and italics, on your assessment.\n[Story A] <Story A>\n[Story B] <Story B>\nThe better story for each dimension is:\nPlot: [A or B or Same]\nCreativity: [A or B or Same]\nCharacter Development: [A or B or Same]\nLanguage Use: [A or B or Same]\nConflict Quality: [A or B or Same]\nTable 2: Prompt template used in automatic evaluation. The LLM receives two generated stories along with detailed definitions\nof each evaluation dimension, and is asked to compare them accordingly. Story content is omitted here for brevity.\nYou are an expert in story evaluation and character development analysis. Your task is to\nassess the consistency of character behavior in a story. Consistency refers to whether\nthe characters’ actions, decisions, and dialogue align with their established traits,\nbackground, and personality as described in their Identity Stable Set.\nHere are the provided character descriptions (ISS) and the story for evaluation:\nCharacter Descriptions (ISS): <Character Descriptions (ISS)>\nStory: <Story>\nEvaluation Task:\nBehavior Consistency Analysis: Assess the story based on the following criteria:\n1. Alignment with ISS: Do the characters’ actions, decisions, and speech align with their\nISS descriptions (e.g., traits, lifestyle, and current state)?\n2. Believability: Are the characters’ behaviors logical and consistent within the story’s\ncontext and their established traits?\n3. Avoidance of Contradictions: Are there any moments where characters behave in a way that\ndirectly contradicts their ISS?\nProvide a score on a scale of 0 to 10, where:\n0 means \"The characters are completely inconsistent with their ISS descriptions.\"\n10 means \"The characters are perfectly consistent with their ISS descriptions.\"\nTable 3: Prompt template used for evaluating Character Behavior Consistency in multi-agent simulation-based stories. The\nLLM assesses whether characters’ actions and dialogue are coherent with their predefined persona attributes, using a structured\nrubric and a 0-10 scoring scale.\nStory 1\n[Premise]\nAfter a strange phenomenon causes time to freeze for everyone except for a small group of\nindividuals, a young scientist named Claire must find a way to reverse the event before she\nloses her sanity.\n[Setting]\nThe story takes place in a modern-day city that has suddenly fallen into an eerie state of\nparalysis, with the world frozen in place.\n[Characters]\nClaire Matthews: A brilliant but socially awkward physicist in her early 30s.\nDr. Harold Reed: An older scientist and Claire’s mentor.\nTommy Harris: A troubled teenager who sees the event as a chance to escape his problems.\nSophia Lutz: A police officer trying to maintain order in the chaos.\nChris Tanaka: A tech expert who believes the phenomenon is a computer glitch.\nMaya Harrison: A woman who was in the middle of an argument with her partner when time froze.\nCharacter 1: Claire Matthews\nName: Claire Matthews\nAge: 32\nInnate: Brilliant, analytical, introverted\nLearned: Claire Matthews is a physicist with a specialization in quantum mechanics and\ntemporal phenomena.

For the evaluation presented in this paper, we employ\nthe llama3.1:8b-instruct-fp16 model.\nReproducing Re3\nThe Re3 method requires the specification of a story’s\npremise, setting, and character names and descriptions.\nTherefore, we can directly adapt the corresponding data\nfrom the dataset to match the required format for Re3. Since\nRe3 utilizes models such as text-davinci-002, and to\nensure fairness in the experiment, we replace these models\nwith GPT-4o mini. For other hyperparameter settings, we\nuse the default configurations provided by the method.\nReproducing DOC-V2\nDuring the reproduction of DOC-V2, we observed that the\nprompts used in this method often resulted in parsing fail-\nures. Additionally, since this method does not specify the\ntype of story, we set the story type of this method to “narra-\ntive” during evaluation. To ensure fairness, we replaced all\nOpenAI engines used in this method with GPT-4o mini.\nReproducing IBSEN\nDuring the reproduction of IBSEN, we observed that this\nmethod primarily utilizes a multi-agent virtual sandbox for\ngenerating theatrical scripts. As a result, it is necessary to\nfirst convert the premise, setting, and characters from the\ndataset into the specific data format required by IBSEN.\nTo achieve this transformation, we employed GPT-4o\nmini to automatically process the conversion. This step en-\nsures that the data is correctly formatted and fully compati-\nble with IBSEN’s input requirements, ultimately allowing us\nto generate the necessary script files and other related out-\nputs.\nThe final output of this method consists of log files con-\ntaining dialogues between different characters. Since these\nlogs primarily capture character interactions in a structured\nmanner, we leveraged a large language model (LLM) to fur-\nther refine them into coherent and fluent stories. This post-\nprocessing step enhances readability and ensures that the\ngenerated stories flow naturally, making them suitable for\nevaluation and further analysis.\nImplementation Details of StoryBox\nIn the multi-agent virtual sandbox simulation of this method,\nseveral hyperparameters are configurable to tailor the envi-\nronment to the needs of the generation process. The simula-\ntion is initialized at the timestamp “2024-09-01 12:00 AM”,\nwith each simulation step representing a time interval of one\nhour. We utilize sqlite3 as the underlying database to\nstore and manage the simulation data.\nFor\nthe\nembedding\nmodule,\nwe\nuse\nthe\njinaai/jina-embeddings-v3\nmodel\nto\ngener-\nate embeddings, ensuring a robust representation of textual\ninformation. When integrating a large language model\n(LLM) into the simulation, we set the model’s temperature\nto 0.8, with a maximum of five attempts to parse each\ngenerated output. Our observations suggest that this config-\nuration typically allows for successful parsing within the\nset number of attempts. If the output cannot be successfully\nparsed within these attempts, the current iteration for the\naffected agent is skipped, but the simulation proceeds with\nthe remaining agents.\nThe LLM is configured with a timeout of 60 seconds per\nquery. The context window size is capped at 102,400 tokens,\nwhich is approximately 80% of the model’s maximum con-\ntext window capacity of 128,000 tokens. This ensures that\nwe maintain an optimal balance between context coverage\nand computational efficiency.\nIn the agent’s planning module, we introduce an “abnor-\nmal factor” set to 0.3, meaning that there is a 30% probabil-\nity for an agent to exhibit abnormal behavior during its plan-\nning phase. This randomness is introduced to simulate un-\npredictable or creative decision-making, enhancing the dy-\nnamic nature of the simulation.\nFor the agent’s execution module, the dialogue is struc-\ntured to consist of two interaction cycles, resulting in a total\nof four conversational turns (two exchanges per agent). This\nconfiguration allows for a meaningful exchange while keep-\ning the dialogue concise enough to maintain relevance to the\nongoing story.\nFinally, in the FAISS-based vector database, we set the\nvector dimension to 512, providing a balance between high-\nquality embedding representation and efficient storage and\nretrieval capabilities for the agent interactions.\nIn our experiments, GPU-dependent components, such\nas locally deployed embedding models and large language\nmodels, run on a single NVIDIA GTX 3090 GPU. Other\nmodels, including OpenAI’s models and DeepSeek-V3,\nare accessed via API calls. When using GPT-4o mini for\nmulti-agent sandbox simulations, a setup with six charac-\nters and a simulation time step of one hour requires approxi-\nmately 0.5 hours of real time to simulate a full in-game day.\nConsequently, simulating 7 days takes around 4 hours, while\na 14-day simulation requires approximately 7 hours, includ-\ning both the simulation and story generation processes.\nCase Study\nWe conduct a detailed analysis of a story generated by our\nmethod, as shown in Table 7. In this table, we highlight four\nkey aspects: psychological descriptions, environmental de-\nscriptions, conflicts, and resolutions. Psychological descrip-\ntions are marked in blue with the prefix [Psychological], en-\nvironmental descriptions in orange with the prefix [Environ-\nment], conflicts in red with the prefix [Conflict], and resolu-\ntions in green with the prefix [Resolution]. Additionally, we\nindicate omitted parts of the story by highlighting them in\ngray.\nThe results indicate that the story contains a substantial\namount of psychological and environmental descriptions,\nwith each chapter beginning with an environmental setup.\nIn the first chapter, conflicts are relatively sparse, primarily\nestablishing the premise of the story. As the narrative pro-\ngresses into the second and third chapters, conflicts become\nmore frequent, marking the development phase. In the fourth\nchapter, both conflicts and resolutions emerge, signaling the\nstory’s climax. Finally, in the fifth chapter, conflicts and res-\nolutions disappear, leaving only psychological and environ-\nmental descriptions, indicating the conclusion.\nOverall, the story follows a coherent structure, encom-\npassing an introduction, development, climax, and resolu-\ntion, aligning with conventional storytelling patterns.\nFrozen Echoes: Connections in a Time-Stopped World\nChapter 1: Echoes of Silence\n[Psychological] As Claire Matthews sifted through the remnants of her mentor’s cluttered\noffice, the coldness of the environment seeped into her bones, reminding her of the chilling\nstillness that enveloped Frosthaven. [Environment] Papers were strewn about like fallen\nleaves, remnants of frantic research and desperate hope. She focused on an old, dusty\nnotebook tucked beneath a pile of yellowed documents. Its spine cracked as she opened it,\nrevealing a flurry of handwritten notes filled with equations and sketches of temporal\nmechanics. But what caught her attention was an erratic series of annotations in the margins,\nwritten with a shaky hand, suggesting a connection to the anomaly that had ensnared their\ncity.\n‘‘What is this?’’ she murmured, her pulse quickening. The ink was barely legible, but the\nwords ‘time fracture’ and ‘experiment 47’ stood out starkly. [Psychological] She traced the\nlines with her finger, a mix of excitement and dread bubbling within her. Could this be the\nkey to understanding what had happened?\nJust then, Dr. Harold Reed walked in, his presence cutting through the silence like a\nbeacon. ‘‘Ah, Claire. Diving into the past again, are we?’’ His voice carried a warmth that\nmomentarily eased her growing anxiety. ...[246 words]...\nAs she stepped out of the office, the weight of the notebook felt heavier in her hands, a\ntangible link to the past and a guiding light toward their uncertain future. [Environment]\nThe chilling silence of Frosthaven loomed outside, but inside, Claire’s mind buzzed with\npossibilities. [Psychological] She recalled the faces of her teammates|Maya, with her\nemotional insights; Sophia, with her unwavering leadership; and Tommy, whose scavenged\ncreativity could offer new perspectives. They were bound together not just by the anomaly,\nbut by their own stories, each seeking connection amidst the echoes of their frozen city.\n...[65 words]...\nAs she entered the room, she called out, ‘‘Everyone! I found something! We need to talk about\n‘experiment 47’ and what it could mean for us!’’ The world outside was silent,[Psychological]\nbut inside her heart, a fire was beginning to blaze. [Environment] As the team gathered\naround the long, battered table in the dimly lit makeshift lab, [Psychological] Claire felt\na wave of anticipation ripple through her. The notebook lay open before them, its pages a\nchaotic testament to the desperation that had led to the time freeze. ...[67 words]...\nHe paused, looking each member of the team in the eye as if urging them to unearth their\nvulnerabilities. [Environment] The faint hum of the generator in the corner provided an\neerie backdrop to the silence that followed, amplifying the gravity of Dr. Reed’s words.\n‘‘I propose we share our experiences over the past weeks. Our personal insights might just\nlead us to the connections we need, both in understanding this phenomenon and in healing\nourselves.’’\n[Conflict] Maya, sitting cross-legged on her chair, looked up from her sketchbook. ‘‘But Dr.\nReed, can we really afford to get sidetracked by our feelings? We need to stay focused on the\nscience!’’ ...[33 words]...\nAs Maya processed this, Tommy, who had been fidgeting with a piece of scrap metal, finally\nspoke up. [Conflict] ‘‘I... I can share something. The freeze didn’t just stop time for me;\nit stopped everything. I used to love scavenging through the old tech, finding treasures in\nthe ruins. But now... it’s like everything I find is just a relic of a past I can’t access.\nIt’s frustrating. I feel like I’m stuck in a still frame.’’ ...[492 words]...\n[Environment] The silence of Frosthaven still hung outside like a heavy fog, but within\nthe room, a flicker of warmth had taken root, hinting at the resilience they would need to\nnavigate the challenges that lay ahead. As the discussion wound down, Tommy sat in silence,\nhis eyes drifting to the corner of the makeshift lab where remnants of their scavenged\nmaterials lay haphazardly piled together. [Environment] The metallic glint of circuit boards,\nthe soft sheen of unbroken glass, and scraps of colorful plastic seemed to whisper to him,\nurging him to create something meaningful out of the stillness surrounding them.\n...[508\nwords]...\n[Psychological] Claire felt a warmth spread through her chest as she watched her teammates\ncollaborate, their energies intertwining like threads in a fabric. ‘‘This is what we need,\nisn’t it? To remember that even in the face of this freezing silence, we’re still here, still\nhuman.’’\nAs they stood amidst their creation, the once-frozen city outside felt a bit warmer, the\nsilence a little less oppressive. In that moment, they understood that art|their shared\nexpression of grief and hope|was a powerful tool, one that could bridge the chasm between\ntheir isolation and the humanity they longed to reconnect with.\nWith the installation complete and plans for a community gathering taking shape,\n[Psychological] Claire felt an invigorating breeze of hope swell within her. The journey\ntowards understanding the anomaly had begun, and with it, their paths intertwined ever more\ndeeply, ready to face whatever challenges lay ahead together.\nChapter 2: Fractured Connections\n[Environment] The afternoon sun cast a pale light over the workshop where the team\ncongregated, illuminating the remnants of their collaborative art installation. Claire, with\nsketches scattered around her, stood by the large easel, her brow furrowed in concentration\nas she reviewed the group’s progress. The atmosphere was thick with anticipation, but\ntensions simmered beneath the surface, ready to boil over.\n[Conflict] Chris, immersed in his laptop, suddenly slammed the lid shut, breaking the\nsilence. ‘‘We can’t keep talking about feelings, Claire! We need data, not emotional fluff!\nThis is about survival, not therapy!’’ His voice rose, echoing off the cold concrete walls,\ncausing heads to turn.\n[Psychological] Claire’s heart raced. [Conflict] ‘‘How can you say that? Emotions are part\nof our experience! We can’t just shove them aside as if they don’t matter! If we don’t\nunderstand the human element, how do we hope to solve the anomaly?’’ ...[40 words]...\n[Conflict] Chris scoffed, shaking his head. ‘‘You’re both missing the bigger picture! The\nanomaly is a scientific problem, and we need to treat it as such. Statistics and models,\nthat’s what we need! Not a group therapy session!’’\n[Environment] A heavy silence followed his outburst, filled only by the distant hum of\nthe city’s systems, eerily frozen in time. [Psychological] Claire felt a weight settle in\nher chest, her frustration mixing with the isolation she had been struggling with since\nthe freeze began. She took a deep breath, grounding herself. [Conflict] \\I’m not asking\nfor therapy, Chris. I’m asking for understanding. All of us are feeling the strain of this\nanomaly. If we don’t address the emotional fallout, we risk losing more than just our city|we\nrisk losing ourselves.\" ...[39 words]...\n[Conflict] Chris threw his hands up, cutting him off. ‘‘That’s ridiculous, Tommy! This isn’t\na support group! We’re not here to share our feelings; we’re here to fix a problem!’’ His\nanger was palpable, and the room tensed at the ferocity of his words. ...[54 words]...\nChris clenched his jaw, visibly wrestling with his emotions as he paced the room, his\nagitation bouncing off the walls. [Psychological] The others watched, feeling the weight of\nthe moment. Finally, he turned to Claire, his tone softening slightly. \\I just... I can’t\nafford to lose focus. We’re running out of time.\"\n[Psychological] Claire’s heart softened at his vulnerability. \\None of us can afford to lose\nfocus, Chris. But we’re not in this alone, and we shouldn’t have to carry it all on our\nshoulders. What if we tried combining both approaches? We could analyze the data, but also\ncreate a space for sharing. We could document our emotional states alongside our findings. It\nmight help us see patterns we wouldn’t have considered otherwise.\" ...[81 words]...\nAs the discussion shifted towards finding a framework that honored both their emotional and\nscientific needs, Claire felt a warmth spread through the group. [Psychological] They were\nangry, frustrated, and scared, but they were also moving toward a shared understanding,\nforging a deeper connection amid the chaos. ...[903 words]...\n[Environment] As the sun dipped below the horizon, casting a soft golden glow over\nFrosthaven, Sophia stood in the community center, surveying the room with a mixture of\nexcitement and apprehension. The large, open space was adorned with strings of fairy lights,\ntheir warmth contrasting with the cold, sterile environment of their scientific workspace.\nCanvas draped across tables awaited contributions, and Maya’s masterpiece, ‘Isolation’s\nEmbrace,’ was prominently displayed at the front, its swirling colors capturing the emotional\nstruggles faced by the community. ...[305 words]...\n[Conflict] When it was Chris’s turn to speak, he reluctantly approached the makeshift\nstage, a shadow of frustration crossing his features. ‘‘I appreciate the intent behind this\ngathering, but we have to remember that feelings don’t solve the problem. We need actionable\ndata|statistics, research, something concrete to work with!’’ ...[405 words]...\n[Conflict] Chris sighed, his shoulders slumping. ‘‘I just don’t want to lose focus. If we get\ntoo caught up in emotions, we might miss our chance to save the city.’’ ...[35 words]...\nAs they exited the community center, [Psychological] Claire felt the weight of the evening’s\nrevelations. While the gathering had illuminated hidden tensions, it had also sparked\nconnections that could lead them toward healing. They were still a fractured group, but\ntogether, they could navigate the complexities of their emotions and unite in their quest\nto reclaim Frosthaven. The road ahead would be challenging, but they were beginning to\nunderstand that it was possible to blend their individual desires with a greater purpose|one\nthat could ultimately drive them toward collective resilience.\nChapter 3: The Heart of Inquiry\n[Environment] The air in the makeshift lab crackled with tension as Chris stared at his\ncomputer screen, the bright glow illuminating his furrowed brow. A cacophony of beeping\nalarms punctuated the silence that had settled uneasily over the group, a sound that mirrored\nthe rising pulse of anxiety coursing through everyone present. Claire, Maya, Sophia, and\nTommy stood gathered around him, their expressions a blend of concern and disbelief as the\nreality of Chris’s actions unfolded before them.\n[Conflict] ‘‘What have you done?’’ Claire’s voice trembled slightly, a mixture of fear and\nfrustration. She stepped closer, her mind racing with the implications of the power surge.\n[Conflict] Chris, his hands still hovering over the keyboard, shot her a defiant glance.\n‘‘I was just trying to access the central grid! If we can understand the frozen energy\nsignatures, maybe we can find a way to reverse this freeze. We can save Frosthaven!’’\n...[49\nwords]...\n[Environment] The monitors flickered, reflecting a kaleidoscope of error messages and\nwarnings, each one a testament to the risk they were all contemplating. [Conflict] Tommy\nleaned over Chris’s shoulder, his eyes darting between the screen and the faces of his\nfriends. ‘‘We should think this through. What if we lose everything?’’ He was usually the one\nadvocating for the thrill of experimentation, but this was different. The stakes felt heavier\nnow.\nSophia, who had been quietly observing, stepped forward. Her voice was steady, an anchor\namidst the storm. [Conflict] ‘‘We need to decide if this is the right path. We’re already\nfacing the consequences of our actions|what’s one more gamble on top of all this?’’ Her gaze\nswept across the group, searching for consensus. ‘‘Maybe there’s another way. Let’s take a\nmoment to regroup and consider all our options.’’\n[Psychological] Claire nodded, her heart pounding as she recalled their earlier discussions\nabout balancing emotional clarity with scientific inquiry. ‘‘I agree with Sophia. This isn’t\njust about reversing the anomaly. It’s about us too. We need to find a solution that doesn’t\nput any of you at risk.’’\n[Conflict] Chris’s face hardened at their resistance, yet a flicker of uncertainty crossed\nhis features. ‘‘But we don’t have time to sit around! Every moment we waste, more lives are\nimpacted. People are trapped in this stasis!’’ His voice rose, desperation lacing his words,\nrevealing the turmoil beneath his bravado. ...[50 words]...\nClaire watched Chris as his expression shifted, the wall of bravado beginning to crack. The\ntension in the room thickened, silence stretching out like an elastic band ready to snap.\n[Psychological] Finally, Chris slumped back in his chair, his anger dissipating into a weary\nresignation. ‘‘I just thought... maybe this was the way to prove I’m not just a tech geek who\nhides behind a screen. I wanted to be part of something bigger.’’ ...[30 words]...\nThe group sat in contemplative silence, the weight of their shared isolation settling among\nthem. [Psychological] Claire inhaled deeply, her resolve strengthening. ‘‘Let’s take a step\nback. We can analyze the data from your hack without triggering further consequences. We can\ncreate a simulation. Test it. Navigate the risks together.’’\nAs they discussed their next steps, the room began to hum with a renewed sense of\ncollaboration. They drew on each other’s strengths, merging Claire’s scientific expertise,\nMaya’s creative intuition, and Sophia’s leadership skills. [Psychological] Chris, though\nstill filled with frustration, felt the warmth of camaraderie seeping back into the frigid\nedges of his heart.\nWith the group united, they set to work, sketching out a plan that combined their talents\nwith caution. [Environment] As they delved deeper into the mystery of the freeze, the\nflickering monitors transformed from harbingers of chaos to beacons of hope, reflecting\nthe strength found in their shared determination. [Conflict] This moment marked a turning\npoint|an understanding that every challenge they faced could either drive them apart or forge\nunbreakable bonds, and they chose the latter. ...[322 words]...\n[Environment] As she finished reading, silence enveloped the room, but it wasn’t the same\ntense silence as before. Instead, it felt warm, inviting a space for reflection. Chris\nshifted in his seat, his face softening as he took in her words. ‘‘I never thought of it\nthat way, Maya. I’ve been so focused on the data, on proving myself, that I forgot we’re all\nhuman here, feeling the same fears. It’s easy to hide behind numbers and screens, but I miss\nfeeling connected.’’ ...[54 words]...\n[Psychological] Claire felt a wave of relief wash over her as she realized the significance\nof Maya’s honesty. ‘‘This is what I’ve been trying to express. Our emotional journeys are\njust as important as our scientific ones. If we want to move forward, we need to create a\nsafe space where we can be open with each other. We’re not just colleagues; we’re a team that\nneeds to lean on one another.’’ ...[292 words]...\n[Environment] As the night deepened, the flickering lights of the makeshift lab cast long\nshadows, elongating the figures of Claire Matthews and Dr. Harold Reed as they huddled over\na table strewn with half-filled coffee cups and scattered notes. Outside, the frozen city\nof Frosthaven lay still, a haunting reminder of the urgency that fueled their late-night\ndiscourse. The tension from earlier in the evening had dissipated, replaced by a palpable\nsense of purpose. ...[714 words]...\n[Environment] When they finally stepped away from the table, the energy in the room felt\ncharged, like the calm before a storm of creativity and collaboration. Claire turned to\nDr. Reed, her eyes glinting with determination. ‘‘Let’s bring this to the team. I believe\ntogether, we can thaw the emotional freeze and reignite the spirit of Frosthaven.’’\nAs they prepared to share their newfound idea at the next meeting, [Psychological] Claire\nfelt a thrill of anticipation and the kindling of unity among her friends. They were not just\nresearchers anymore; they were storytellers, artists, and empathizers|ready to weave the rich\ntapestry of their experiences into the heart of their mission. This chapter in their journey\nmarked not just a scientific inquiry, but the dawning of a renewed sense of community, where\nevery voice mattered, and every story echoed with purpose.\nChapter 4: Frozen Reflections\nAs the group settled into the warmth of their makeshift retreat, the ambiance was both somber\nand reflective. [Environment] The room, dimly lit by flickering candles, held remnants of\ntheir earlier discussions|a few sketches from Maya, hastily written notes from Tommy, and a\nwhiteboard filled with diagrams and equations. Outside, the silent city of Frosthaven loomed,\na ghostly reminder of their shared plight.\nClaire shifted uneasily in her seat, glancing at the others. Her heart raced as she sensed\nthe stories hovering just beneath the surface, waiting to be shared. ‘‘You know,’’ she began,\nher voice soft yet steady, ‘‘we all ended up here for a reason. But sometimes I wonder|what\nchoices brought us to this frozen moment?’’ ...[1474 words]...\n[Conflict] ‘‘We can’t just keep talking about feelings and art! We need a solid plan if we\nwant any chance of reversing the anomaly. The science is what matters right now, not these\nsentimental projects!’’ His words cut through the room, sharp and jarring against the hopeful\nenergy.\n[Conflict] Maya, taken aback, responded defensively, ‘‘Chris, this is part of the plan! If we\ndon’t connect emotionally as a team, how can we expect to tackle the scientific challenges?\nYou’re dismissing what we’re trying to build!’’\n[Conflict] Tommy, feeling the tension crackle in the air, hesitated between the two\nperspectives. ‘‘But we’ve seen that our emotions influence our work. If we don’t acknowledge\nthat, we might just be running in circles. We need this... connection. It’s what makes us\nhuman.’’\n[Conflict] Chris shook his head vehemently. ‘‘Humanity is what got us into this mess! We need\nto focus on the cold, hard facts if we want to get out of it!’’\n[Psychological] The argument escalated, voices rising as frustration spilled over. Claire’s\nheart raced; she could feel the rift growing within the group, the very thing they had\nfought to overcome beginning to crack. In this moment of chaos, she felt a familiar pang of\nloneliness, as if the very silence outside had crept into their hearts and taken hold.\nThen, just as it seemed the discussion might devolve into a shouting match, Sophia, who had\nbeen quietly observing, interjected with a calm yet authoritative presence.\n[Conflict] ‘‘Enough!’’ she said, her voice steady and clear, cutting through the tension like\na knife. All eyes turned to her, the room falling silent. ‘‘This isn’t about one approach\nbeing more valid than another. We are all here because we want to overcome the anomaly\ntogether, and we need each other to do that. What we’re creating is not just art; it’s a\nrepresentation of our collective journey. Each of us is valid, and so are our emotions and\nour scientific inquiries.’’ ...[98 words]...\n[Resolution] Sophia stepped closer, her gaze steady. ‘‘And I understand that fear. It’s real\nfor all of us. But remember, fear can’t be the only driver of our actions. We need to harness\nthat fear and turn it into something constructive. Let’s combine our strengths. Can we agree\nto collaborate on both the art and the science? This isn’t about choosing one over the other;\nit’s about integrating everything we have at our disposal.’’\n[Resolution] The honesty in her words began to soften the resolve in Chris’s expression.\n‘‘So, you’re saying we can use the art as a means to inform our research?’’\n[Resolution] ‘‘Exactly!’’ Maya chimed in, her voice rising with newfound enthusiasm. ‘‘If we\nvisualize our findings, it could help make the data more relatable|accessible|especially to\nthe community. We can overlay the emotional narratives we’ve discussed with the scientific\ndata we gather. It’ll be a full-bodied representation of our journey.’’\nWith Sophia’s leadership reestablished, the group began to nod in agreement. [Psychological]\nClaire felt the tension ease, the flickering candlelight dancing around them now feeling warm\ninstead of ominous. ...[45 words]...\n[Resolution] As they shifted their focus back to their collaborative project, Claire’s\nheart swelled with gratitude for Sophia’s ability to unify them. They moved forward,\nsketching ideas and generating plans that would seamlessly weave together their emotional and\nscientific pursuits. The earlier argument faded into the background, replaced by a renewed\nsense of purpose. They were a team once more, ready to tackle the challenges that lay ahead\ntogether.\n[Psychological] In that moment, Claire felt the weight of isolation lift, realizing that they\nweren’t just fighting against the freeze; they were fighting for each other. United, they\nwould explore every avenue to thaw not only the city but the connections that had brought\nthem together in this frozen time.\nChapter 5: Thawing Resilience\n[Environment] The atmosphere in the makeshift lab was thick with anticipation as Claire stood\nbefore her assembled team, a faint hum of energy pulsing through the air. The walls, adorned\nwith sketches and diagrams born from their collective efforts, felt alive with possibility.\n[Psychological] Each of them had poured their hearts into this moment, and now, standing at\nthe precipice of discovery, Claire could feel the weight of their shared hopes resting on her\nshoulders.\n‘‘Alright, everyone, let’s gather around,’’ Claire called out, her voice steady despite\nthe flutter of anxiety in her chest. A mix of determination and vulnerability glimmered\nin her eyes as she gestured to the whiteboard littered with equations and emotional notes.\n‘‘I’ve been thinking about our last discussion|how we need to merge the emotional with the\nscientific. It’s time we made that a reality.’’ ...[1697 words]...\n‘‘Okay, let’s do this,’’ Chris announced, his voice steadying the group as he clicked the\nfinal command. [Environment] The monitors blinked to life, displaying a flurry of colors and\npatterns that mirrored their emotional states.\n[Environment] At first, the screen showed a chaotic mix of reds and blues|confusion and\nfear swirling together. But as the simulation progressed, the colors began to shift, slowly\ntransforming into vibrant hues of green and gold. [Psychological] Claire’s heart raced as she\nrealized what was happening: the emotional resonance they had captured was beginning to have\na tangible effect on the anomaly. ...[272 words]...\n[Environment] As the team took a collective breath, the thawing in the city continued, their\nnewfound awareness grounding them even as they reveled in the joy of discovery. With each\npassing moment, the icy grip on Frosthaven began to wane, revealing glimpses of life that had\nbeen frozen in time.\nClaire turned to her team, a fierce determination igniting in her. ‘‘Let’s document\neverything. Our findings|the emotional model, the data, and the city’s response. We need\nto understand how our connections are shaping this thaw. It’s not just about stopping the\nfreeze. It’s about healing ourselves and our community.’’ ...[92 words]...\n[Psychological] As the visuals danced on the screen, Claire caught sight of the\ncityscape|once lifeless, it now thrummed with the potential of awakening. She felt a surge of\nemotion, a bittersweet reminder of how far they had come. But she also recognized that this\nwas just the beginning.\n‘‘Let’s keep pushing,’’ she urged, her voice rising above the excitement. ‘‘As we integrate\nmore data, we’ll invite the community to share their experiences. This isn’t just our story;\nit’s a collective one. Together, we can truly understand and harness the emotional energy\nthat’s unlocking the city.’’\nThe team rallied around her words, their spirits invigorated by the vision of what lay ahead.\nWith the city beginning to thaw, they were not only on the precipice of discovery but were\nalso embedded in a transformative journey that would redefine their lives and the essence of\nFrosthaven itself.\nTable 7: Color-coded annotations in the generated story.

    "content": "# StoryBox Paper Explanation\n\n```markdown\n## 1. Core Content and Main Contributions\n\n### Core Content\nThis paper introduces **StoryBox**, a novel approach to long-form story generation that mimics the creative process of human authors: first constructing an overarching mental scene, then naturally unfolding the narrative through character interactions and environmental influences. To achieve this, the authors designed a multi-agent simulation system based on large language models (LLMs), where virtual characters autonomously act, communicate with each other, and interact with their environment within a dynamic sandbox. These interactions produce \"emergent events\" that form the foundation of the story. A dedicated \"Storyteller Agent\" then integrates these events into coherent and vivid long-form narratives.\n\nThe entire process follows a **hybrid bottom-up** framework:\n- **Bottom-up component**: Agents spontaneously generate events in the sandbox.\n- **Top-down component**: The Storyteller Agent summarizes, organizes, and narrates these events into structured prose.\n\nThis method avoids the mechanical feel and rigid plot structures typical of traditional top-down approaches (e.g., outlining first, then filling in details), resulting in more organic character development and natural plot progression.\n\n### Key Contributions\n1. **Proposing a Multi-Agent Simulation Framework**: A dynamic sandbox system capable of generating rich, contextually relevant story events through agent behaviors.\n2. **Innovative Hybrid Bottom-Up Narrative Mechanism**: Combines emergent event generation from the bottom up with top-down structural guidance, enabling natural character growth and plot evolution.\n3. **Successful Generation of High-Quality Long-Form Stories**: The system can stably generate novels exceeding 10,000 words, demonstrating strong performance in coherence and consistency—addressing key challenges in long-text generation.\n4. **Open-Sourcing and Empirical Validation**: The project is publicly available at https://storyboxproject.github.io, with both human and automated evaluations confirming its state-of-the-art performance across multiple dimensions.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Breakthroughs and Innovations\n\n### (1) Paradigm Shift: From \"Predefined Structure\" to \"Organic Growth\"\nTraditional long-form story generation relies heavily on pre-defined plot structures (such as outlines or chapter plans), representing a classic top-down approach. While such methods ensure basic structure, they often lead to stereotypical character behavior and predictable plots.\n\n**StoryBox breaks this mold by reversing the logic**: Instead of prescribing plot directions, it allows characters to freely act within the sandbox according to their personalities, goals, and surroundings, letting events emerge organically through interaction. This design closely mirrors real-world storytelling—writers don’t recite scripts verbatim but rather “discover” how stories unfold driven by characters.\n\n### (2) Fine-Grained Character Modeling and Abnormal Behavior Mechanism\nEach character is defined using six attribute categories:\n- Name, Age  \n- Innate traits  \n- Learned experiences  \n- Current state  \n- Lifestyle  \n- Daily Plan Requirements  \n\nNotably, the paper introduces an **Abnormal Behavior Attribute**, controlled by a hyperparameter called the “Abnormal Factor,” which determines the probability of a character deviating from their routine. This prevents repetitive patterns, increases dramatic tension and unpredictability, and significantly boosts creativity scores.\n\n### (3) Tree-Based Hierarchical Environment Modeling Replacing Grid Systems\nUnlike prior works (e.g., Generative Agents) that use coordinate-based tile environments, StoryBox adopts a **five-level tree structure** (World → Region → Zone → Area → Object). This hierarchical model supports flexible expansion and describes spatial relationships without requiring precise coordinates. It enhances modeling flexibility and system scalability, enabling the construction of virtually infinite virtual worlds.\n\n### (4) Dynamic Window Summarization + Iterative Writing Pipeline\nTo handle massive event data beyond LLM context limits, StoryBox implements a two-stage summarization mechanism:\n1. Summarizing events by character/day;\n2. Using a \"dynamic window\" mechanism to automatically segment and compress event sequences.\n\nThen, the Storyteller Agent generates chapters iteratively. After completing each chapter, its summary is added to a historical memory buffer and used as input for the next chapter. This hybrid architecture—\"Bottom-Up Information Retrieval + Top-Down Writing\"—effectively balances information density with narrative fluency.\n\n### (5) Comprehensive Evaluation Framework\nThe paper employs a **mixed evaluation strategy combining human judgments and automatic metrics**, testing across six dimensions: Plot, Creativity, Character Development, Language Use, Conflict Quality, and Overall Coherence. Results show that StoryBox outperforms existing methods—including GPT-4o, DOC-V2, and IBSEN—on all metrics, particularly excelling in character development and conflict quality.\n\n---\n\n## 3.
