Drawing on recent work in the phi-\nlosophy of creativity, I distinguish between creative approaches and creative products,\nand introduce the concept of disciplinary creativity—the creative application of discipline-\nspecific expertise to a valued problem within that field. Through two cases in mathematics,\nI show that while computation can extend disciplinary creativity, certain approaches involv-\ning AI can serve to displace it. This displacement has the potential to alter (and, perhaps,\ndiminish) the value of scientific pursuit.\n1\nPreliminaries\nPhilosophy has a long and storied tradition of worrying about new technologies displacing\nhuman capacities.\nIn the Phaedrus, Socrates worries that the invention of and increasing\nreliance upon writing results in two significant epistemic displacements. Writing is believed\nto, first, displace memory by storing contents that would otherwise be remembered in static\ncharacters external to the mind. In doing this, writing encourages a shift in our means of recall\nfrom something active and within ourselves to something passive and external. Because we can\nconsult what has been written, we no longer need to remember —we can simply be reminded.\nMoreover, writing is thought to, in turn, displace genuine wisdom. Since recollection no longer\nrelies upon something internal to and constitutive of wisdom, nor on something with which\nwe can actively debate and interrogate, in referring to what has been written to inform us, we\ncome to only appear wise.\nBut, of course, writing also serves to massively extend our capacities beyond what is\npossible through the exercise of memory alone. The wisdom of Socrates, for instance, reaches\nand continues to actively engage us from the distant past, not through an oral tradition in the\nservice of sustaining collective memory, but through external storage in writing. In a sense,\nthen, writing serves both as a prosthetic and as an amputation.\nWorries analogous to those of Socrates’ concern with writing have attended the invention\nof and reliance upon computation in science. For instance, after the introduction of mechanical\n‗Email: eduede@purdue.edu\n1\narXiv:2510.23734v1  [cs.AI]  27 Oct 2025\n(as opposed to human) calculators in mathematics and physics in the mid-20th century, many\nwere concerned that the result would be a loss of so-called ‘number sense’ in those who use\nthem. This concern was likely well-founded. After all, Poincaré, von Neumann, Gauss, and\nFeynman have all been credited with remarkable contributions to mathematics and physics\nowing in large part to their tremendously fine numerical intuition, itself iteratively refined\nthrough a lifetime of obsessive internal calculation.\nMore recently, philosophers and scientists have begun to wrestle with a set of epistemo-\nlogical concerns that arise from the use of forms of computation in science that are far more\npowerful than mere calculators. For instance, it has been argued that increasingly routine\nreliance on artificial intelligence leads scientists to adopt beliefs that are not fully justifiable due\nto the complexity and opacity of the models that support them. Moreover, it has been argued\nthat the epistemic opacity of these systems limits scientific understanding of the phenomena\nunder investigation, perhaps raising a dark veil between the practice of science and scientific\nknowledge.\nThese concerns echo early 21st century worries surrounding the use of computational sim-\nulation in science. Notably, Paul Humphreys, in considering the impact of such computational\napproaches on scientific knowledge, argued that contemplation of these impacts is philosophi-\ncally interesting precisely because the methods of computational science induce a displacement\nperhaps more general than that which exercised Socrates. For Humphreys, the hybrid scenario\nin which humans and machines work in concert to generate new scientific knowledge is thought\nto give rise to a novel displacement in which computationally assisted science pushes “humans\naway from the centre of the epistemological enterprise.” [Hum09, pg. 616]\nA common thread that runs through this history of concerns is the sense that what is gained,\nwhether by writing, using calculators, or some other technological advance, is accompanied by\na loss. In the case of calculation, what is gained is the capability to very quickly solve or estimate\nsolutions to otherwise intractable mathematical or statistical problems. But, what is lost is a\nfeeling for numbers and functions that was, itself, of great utility for making mathematical\nprogress more generally. Moreover, like in the case of writing, the thought is that what is lost\nor traded away is an ability or capacity of ours.\nThis paper joins the tradition and argues that, in addition to pushing humans away from\nthe center of the epistemological enterprise, recent advances in the use of artificial intelligence in\nscience signal a concomitant displacement of disciplinary creativity and expertise, and that this\ndecentering has the potential to significantly scale up our collective problem-solving capacity\nby extending it beyond what is possible through the exercise of disciplinary creativity alone.\nBut, this decentering also has the potential to radically alter (and, perhaps, diminish) the value\nof scientific pursuit.\nHere, then, is the plan. In Section 2, drawing from the literature on creativity, I bring\nout a distinction between creative approaches and creative products. Focusing on the latter,\nin Section 3 I develop the concept of disciplinary creativity and claim that, in the case of\nmathematics, we are likely to observe an increase in the stock of mathematically creative proofs\n(products), but the disciplinary creativity employed by the human in the generation of the\nproof (approaches) needn’t be specifically mathematical creativity. In Section 4, I present two\n2\ncases from mathematics involving computation in which researchers solve valued problems\nin ways that are arguably quite creative. However, only the first depends on mathematical\ndisciplinary creativity.\n2\nCreativity\nPhilosophers have long been interested in creativity. Great works of art, literature, inventions of\ngreat utility, as well as scientific and philosophical theories that transform how we understand\nour world and place in it —these all seem to display and depend upon acts of creativity.\nPhilosophical interest has spawned a diverse literature containing a wide range of accounts of\nwhat constitutes creativity as a capacity. In trying to make sense of creativity as a capacity,\nBerys Gaut notes [Gau10] that in the Ion, Plato likens creative states to a form of madness in\nwhich the mind and senses abandon us [Pla61]. Whereas, in the Critique of Judgment, Kant\nlinks creativity to an exercise of the imagination unchecked by the understanding [Kan00].\nIn contrast to accounts advancing something like a transcendent conception, in the Poetics,\nAristotle saw creativity as a skillful application of rules and heuristics [Hal95].\nIn addition to attempting to define creativity, contemporary work has sought to understand\nwhat distinguishes creative approaches from creative results. There is general agreement that we\ncan judge some results (say a work of art or a scientific theory) as more creative than others.\nA prominent view in this respect is due to Boden who holds that results, whether an idea or\nartifact, are judged to be creative if they are novel, surprising, and valuable [Bod98, Kin22].\nMore recently, debate has concerned the relationship between approaches and results, and,\nspecifically, whether an approach can be deemed creative regardless of the status of its result\n[HB19, Lan24]. This debate turns on the relevance and importance of ‘value’ in judgments\nconcerning creativity with some arguing that, without a valued result, an approach cannot be\ndeemed creative. For the purposes of this paper, we can set debates concerning value aside.\nWhile I am sympathetic to the idea that judgments concerning creativity need not involve\nascriptions of value, it seems reasonable that there are particular contexts in which valuable\nsolutions require creativity.\nThat is, sometimes, while value may or may not required for\ncreativity, creativity is required for value.\nOne area where this idea seems particularly salient is in science and, more specifically,\nscientific problem-solving. Reflecting on scientific problem-solving, Herbert Simon and Allen\nNewell argued that creative problem-solving is a distinctive kind of problem-solving generally,\nmarked, in a manner similar to Boden’s conception, by novelty, unconventional approaches,\nsustained effort, and challenges in framing the problem itself [NSS62]. Boden further differenti-\nates approaches into combinational (combining existing ideas), exploratory (extending existing\nconceptual frameworks), and transformational (radically altering conceptual spaces) creativity,\neach corresponding to different broad categories of creative approach [Bod98, Bod05]. While\nthere is no consensus on what features or characteristics an approach must posses to be deemed\ncreative [Gau10], there is general agreement that an approach will not count as creative if it\ncentrally depends on guessing, pure luck (knocking over paint buckets and producing beautiful\nimages), a purely random process (chimps scribbling away), brute force (mechanically check-\n3\ning every possible solution) [Mor21, Deu91, Dut09, Gau10, Hal21, HB19]1. As we will see in\nSection 3, for any given problem, there may be many different approaches to its solution. Some\nproblems can be solved through the application of either creative or uncreative approaches.\n3\nDisciplinary Creativity\nComing up with creative approaches to solving problems is indispensable for the sciences\n[Sim04, Dun97]. Yet, the sciences are made up of many distinct disciplines D the problems and\napproaches of which are highly varied. So, to fix ideas, let’s consider one specific discipline\n—mathematics. Suppose that mathematicians greatly value a solution to a particular problem\nP (say, the proof of some long-standing conjecture). There may be any number of reasons\nwhy mathematicians value a solution to P. However, it is evident that they do so from the\nmany observable attempts they have collectively made at solving it over the years [Ven24].\nNow, suppose someone solves the problem. From what we have seen already, determining\nwhether the approach to the solution should be deemed creative would depend on factors that\nare, perhaps, still to be worked out. But, most all accounts would agree that the solution would\nnot count as a creative one if it were arrived at by, for instance, successive guessing, a purely\nrandom process, a brute force approach involving the mechanical checking of every possible\nsolution, or by sheer luck.\nAs a result, in order for a solution to P to count as a creative solution, it would need to meet\nthe following condition:\nCreative Approach: P is solved by means of a specific approach that would be\ndeemed creative on the correct account of creativity.\nFor our purposes, the apparent circularity of Creative Approach is not problematic because\nour immediate goal is only to have a conceptual resource with which to distinguish between\ncreative approaches and merely successful problem-solving approaches rather than to fully\ndefine creativity itself. In this way, we can black-box a complete specification of creativity\n(leaving the precise details deliberately unspecified) while still harvesting sufficient conceptual\nresources to, in what follows, construct a philosophically helpful definition of disciplinary\ncreativity.\nNow, for any given problem in science, there may be many solutions. For example, suppose\nwe are confronted with the problem P of finding the sum of the first 100 positive integers. Let\nus consider three approaches to solving this problem.\nApproach One to solving the problem is due to Gauss, who observed the following symmetry.\nIf one pairs the first and last integers (1 and 100), the second and second-to-last (2 and 99), and\nso on, each pair sums to the same value:\n(1 + 100) + (2 + 99) + (3 + 98) + · · · + (50 + 51).\nSince each pair sums to 101, and there are 50 such pairs, the solution to P is:\n1Though, as we will see in considering the proof plan for the four color theorem, some brute-force approaches\ncan still be hard-won and even ingenious\n4\n50 × 101 = 5050.\nApproach Two to solving P exploits an observed geometric symmetry. Here, one can imagine\ndots arranged in a triangular pattern (as below). Each dot corresponds to an integer. One starts\nby placing a single dot in the first row, then two dots in the second row, three in the third,\ncontinuing in this way up to 100 dots in the 100th row.\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\nIf one were to duplicate this triangle and rotate the copy, the two together would form a\nrectangle with dimensions 100 by 101. Of course, the area of the rectangle is the product of its\ndimensions and represents the total number of dots in both triangles. So, dividing the area by\ntwo yields the solution to P:\n100 × 101\n2\n= 5050.\nThere are many more solutions to P, but let’s consider a brute force, computational ap-\nproach. Approach Three to solving the problem involves using a computer. In Python, one can\nsimply call the following:\nsum(range(1, 101))\nIn this case, the computer begins by adding 0 and 1, then adds 2 to that sum, then 3 to the\nresult, and so on, continuing in this way until it has added all of the integers from 1 to 100.2\nIn doing so, Approach Three definitively solves P by brute force —but without recognizing or\nexploiting any deeper structure in the problem.\nOf our three approaches to solving P, we can say with some certainty that Approach Three,\nin which we used a computer to sum the first 100 integers, fails to satisfy the condition specified\nby Creative Approach because the approach is brute-force and purely mechanical in nature.\nNow, for the sake of argument, assume that Gauss’ approach (Approach One) satisfies the\nconditions of Creative Approach. That is, on the correct account of creativity, Gauss’ approach\nwould count as creative. Since (on assumption) at least one of our approaches satisfies Creative\nApproach, and at least one does not, and since all three of the considered approaches led\nto a solution to the problem P, it is clear that an approach to a problem need not satisfy the\nconditions on Creative Approach to, nevertheless, count as a solution to a problem. Importantly,\nhowever, to count as creative, such conditions must be met.\nWe are now in a position to put forward an account of disciplinary creativity and identify\nconditions under which it may be identified. First, notice that Creative Approach is general\nenough to be applied across broadly heterogeneous problems and problem areas. For instance,\nthe set of plausible approaches to the problem of designing a vaccine for a novel virus and\n2Note that in Python, the range function is half-open, meaning range(1, 101) includes 1 but excludes 101.\n5\nthe set of plausible approaches to the problem of finding the sum of the first 100 positive\nintegers are likely to be completely different. Nevertheless, there are creative and uncreative\nways to accomplish both. Moreover, these distinct sets of plausible approaches do not differ\nmerely in content but, rather, are shaped and constrained by the disciplinary frameworks\nwithin which the problems they address emerge.\nVaccine design operates on expertise in\nand within the constraints of immunology, virology, biochemical engineering, and clinical\ntrial protocols. Mathematical problem-solving employs expertise in and respects constraints of\naxioms, theorems, and obeys formal reasoning rules and structures unique to mathematics and\nlogic. Finally, it is widely acknowledged that disciplinary boundedness indicates that creativity\nin each domain requires not just general creative capacity, but domain-specific expertise and\nskill [WM09] that can be creatively (or uncreatively) applied to problems that are recognizable\nto and valued by its practitioners [Bae98, Bod05, Bod98].\nThis suggests that an approach to a problem will demonstrate disciplinary creativity only if\nit satisfies at least the following three conditions. The first is simply that the approach must\nmeet the conditions of Creative Approach (e.g., it has to be creative). The second is a valuation\ncondition on the problem such that P is recognizable as a problem for a specific discipline PD\nand is recognized as valuable, significant, or otherwise important to experts of that discipline\nD from which it emerges. This anchors the problem within a disciplinary context and indicates\nthat its resolution bears significance for that discipline. The third is that the approach involves\nthe appropriate application A of knowledge, skills, or methodologies distinctive to discipline\nD. This condition indicates that the approach is centered on, draws upon, and is responsive to\nthe norms, resources, and background knowledge of the relevant discipline.\nFrom this, we can define disciplinary creativity in the following way:\nDisciplinary Creativity: the creative application A of discipline-D-specific exper-\ntise to solve some problem PD valued by experts in D.\nConsider Andrew Wiles’ proof of Fermat’s Last Theorem [Wil95, TW95]. This number-\ntheoretic problem PD was long recognized as significant and highly valued by mathematicians\nD. It asks whether there exist positive integers a, b, and c such that an + bn = cn for any\ninteger n > 2.\nWiles’ approach involved the application of highly specialized discipline-\nspecific tools and methods. Rather than attacking the problem directly, he proved a special\ncase of the Modularity Theorem, establishing a deep and previously conjectural connection\nbetween elliptic curves and modular forms. Suppose we assume (and this is likely as safe\nan assumption as one can make) that Wiles’ approach satisfies Creative Approach. Then, the\nresulting proof meets the conditions for Disciplinary Creativity: the creative application of\ndiscipline-D-specific expertise to a problem PD recognized as valuable by experts in D.\nBy contrast, consider a hypothetical case in which a group of physicists attempts to design a\nvaccine for a novel virus, P, using only tools and concepts from statistical mechanics, without\ndrawing on established immunological knowledge, virological data, or clinical trial design.\nSuppose further that their approach satisfies the criteria for Creative Approach and ultimately\nproduces a viable vaccine.\nEven so, it would fail to meet the conditions for Disciplinary\nCreativity. Although Pn is a problem recognized as valuable within a specific discipline Dn\n6\n(namely, immunology or virology) the approach does not involve the application of expertise\ndistinctive to that discipline. Instead, it represents the creative application of discipline-Dm-\nspecific expertise (physics) to a problem situated outside Dm’s domain and addresses a problem\nnot recognized as valuable by experts in Dm. In this case, the result is still creative, but it does\nnot qualify as disciplinary creativity. This contrast helps clarify what is at stake in identifying\nan approach as an instance of disciplinary creativity —not merely that it is creative, but that it\narises from, and contributes to, the epistemic life of a specific discipline.\nWhile the hypothetical case of vaccine design is admittedly fanciful, it nonetheless illustrates\nhow disciplinary creativity can be displaced in some problem space. The cases I introduce in\nSection 4, however, bring out how computation can both preserve and extend disciplinary\ncreativity in mathematics and displace it.\n4\nComputation and Disciplinary Creativity\n4.1\n4CT: Mechanized Mathematical Creativity\nIn 1976, mathematicians Kenneth Appel and Wolfgang Haken proved what is commonly\nreferred to as the Four Color Theorem (4CT) [AH76]. The theorem says that every planar\ngraph (no loops) can be colored using at most four colors such that no two adjacent vertices\nshare the same color. Versions of the conjecture have been under investigation since at least the\nmid-19th Century.\nThe proof begins by noting that any planar graph can be transformed into a triangulation\n(a graph in which every face is a triangle) by adding edges without affecting colorability. This\nreduces the problem to proving the four-colorability of maximal planar graphs. Since this is an\ninfinite class, the proof cannot proceed by brute force. Appel and Haken instead demonstrate\nthat every planar triangulation must contain at least one configuration from a finite, explicitly\nconstructed set known as the unavoidable set. To identify this set, they employ the method of\ndischarging, which draws an analogy to electrical charge. Using Euler’s formula, they assign\nan initial charge to each vertex based on its degree, such that the total charge across the graph is\nfixed (in fact, negative). Discharging rules then redistribute this charge locally across the graph,\npreserving the total but concentrating positive charge in certain small configurations. These\nconfigurations are exhaustively enumerated and shown to occur in every triangulation—that\nis, they are unavoidable. The final step is to verify, using computer-assisted methods, that\neach of these configurations is reducible—that is, cannot occur in a minimal counterexample\nto the theorem. Since every triangulation must contain one of these reducible configurations,\nno minimal counterexample can exist, and the Four Color Theorem follows.\nHere, the problem of proving 4CT is clearly a problem Pm belonging to the discipline\nof mathematics Dm. While the approach does involve a brute-force component, it remains\ndisciplinarily mathematical. In the final step, Appel and Haken employed a supercomputer\nto verify the four-colorability of each configuration in the unavoidable set. This step is of-\nten characterized as brute-force, but this characterization is misleading. The machine is not\nexhaustively checking every possible coloring of every planar graph. Rather, the program is\nverifying the four-colorability of a finite class of configurations explicitly identified by prior\n7\nsteps in the proof. This verification could, in principle, be carried out by hand (albeit with\ngreat difficulty and requiring untold amounts of time). It has been noted that, in this way\nthe machine is performing nothing other than a mechanized mobilization and application of\nordinary human mathematical capacities [Bur98, DD]. Moreover, because the proof proceeds\nby reducing the infinite class of graphs to a finite, representative set and establishing a gen-\neral result by covering these cases, it follows the structure of a proof by induction. Far from\nundermining its mathematical standing, the use of computation in this context reflects the (po-\ntentially) creative application of discipline-Dm-specific methods to a problem Pm recognized\nas central and valuable to mathematics.\nIn contrast to the Appel-Haken case, I turn now to a case involving the use of artificial\nintelligence in mathematics, the analysis of which illustrates a displacement of disciplinary\ncreativity.\n4.2\nDisplaced Mathematical Creativity\nIn the 4CT case, a computer encodes and carries out the mathematically creative approach\nconceived by mathematicians Appel and Haken to evaluating the four-colorability of planar\ngraphs. In this section, I consider a case in which computational systems involving a large\nlanguage model are arranged in a way that results in a breakthrough in a problem area of\nextremal combinatorics known as the Cap Set Problem.\nA cap set is a subset of (Z/3Z)n\ncontaining no three distinct elements that sum to 0 (mod 3). For each dimension n, determining\nthe maximum possible size of such a set remains an open challenge. While this number is\nnecessarily bounded above by 3n [Gro19], exact values have only been established for n ≤6.\nImportantly, for our purposes, the solution space grows exponentially with increasing n. As a\nresult, it is, in practice, not possible to make progress on the problem by means of brute-force\ncomputational approaches. This is the kind of problem for which it seems creativity is required.\nIn [RPBN+23], the problem that researchers seek to find a solution to is the construction\nof the largest cap set for n = 8. This is a problem PD in and valued by experts in extremal\ncombinatorics D. The researchers’ approach to the problem is to devise a multi-step, algorithmic\nframework connecting multiple computational structures that collectively construct cap sets for\narbitrary values of n. Importantly (as I discuss below), this same framework can be leveraged\nto solve arbitrary problems, for which a solution can take the form of a computer program.\nThe approach yielded a cap set of 512, the largest verified set for n = 8. Previously, the largest\nknown cap set for n = 8 was 496, making this result a meaningful contribution to a valued\nproblem in the discipline.\nThe approach is a framework built up from the following elements. A fast-inference large\nlanguage model built on PaLM2 called Codey [ADF+23]. This LLM is fine-tuned on a publicly\navailable corpus of computer code and has as its objective the generation of accurate code\nacross various programming languages. Importantly, the model is not specifically fine-tuned\non domain-D-specific text, nor is it trained to solve problems in mathematics more generally.\nThe framework also includes an evaluator called evaluate(), a program that checks proposed\nsolutions to the problem and scores them. evaluate() is the framework’s only component\ncontaining any domain-specific information. Specifically, evaluate() checks whether a pro-\n8\nposed set of vectors satisfies the cap set constraint that no three vectors sum to zero in (Z/3Z)n.\nFinally, there is a database in which candidate solutions to the problem are stored.\nThe framework works as follows. The researchers pass a skeleton Python program contain-\ning a function called solve(n) to the LLM, where n corresponds to the dimension for which the\nlargest cap set is sought. The LLM then generates code for a function called priority(), which\nassigns a numerical score to each candidate vector in (Z/3Z)n that reflects the desirability of\nincluding that vector in the cap set. Once the new priority() function is composed into the\ncomplete program, it is executed via a wrapper function (typically called main()) which calls\nsolve(n) and passes the resulting set to the evaluator. If the vectors included in the cap set\nsatisfy the cap set constraint, the evaluator assigns a numerical value equal to the size of the\nproposed cap set for n. The program is then stored in the database. This cycle (from the input of\na skeleton to the generation of a candidate function to the evaluation of the resulting program\nand storage of programs that do not violate the cap set constraint) constitutes a single pass of\nthe algorithm. On subsequent passes, a number of high-scoring programs are sampled from\nsubpopulations in the database and prepended to the input to the LLM, which is prompted to\nimprove the priority() function in light of these prior examples. This whole process repeats\non the order of 106 times until no further progress is made.\nThis recursive approach enables the framework to converge on increasingly effective solu-\ntions without human intervention into the domain-specific logic of the problem. As I argue\nbelow, this architecture realizes a form of problem-solving that is creative but no longer disci-\nplinary in the traditional sense.\nHere, the problem of constructing the largest cap set for n = 8 is a problem Pc belonging to\nthe discipline of extremal combinatorics Dc. The approach, however, does not centrally involve\nthe application of discipline-Dc-specific knowledge or methods by a domain expert. Instead, the\napproach to solving the problem involves the arrangement of computational components (most\nnotably, a large language model not specifically trained on mathematical texts or for the solving\nof mathematical problems) to recursively generate, modify, and test Python programs against\na mathematical constraint. The only component of the system that encodes any discipline-\nDc-specific content is the evaluate() evaluator, which simply checks whether a given output\nsatisfies the cap set condition. The LLM is not guided by the mathematical insights of its\ncreators, nor does it mechanically implement techniques distinctive to combinatorics in a way\nanalogous to Appel and Haken’s machine. Rather, the LLM generates code that scores well\naccording to the evaluator, and the framework iterates without any reference to, or embedding\nin, the discipline’s background knowledge, methods, or normative practices.\nWhile the approach’s iterative, feedback-guided refinement of its own outputs may well\ncount as creative in a general sense or in, say, an engineering sense, the approach fails to\nmeet the criteria for disciplinary creativity. Even if we assume that the approach is creative,\nwe cannot say that it came about through the creative application of discipline-Dc-specific\nexpertise (e.g., the exercise of mathematical creativity). The approach to finding a solution\nusing the framework discussed here is also not an instance of interdisciplinary creativity,\nwhere insights from multiple disciplines are brought into productive conversation, but rather a\ncase in which disciplinary centering is bypassed altogether (as in the imagined case of vaccine\n9\ndesign considered above). Nevertheless, the approach is likely creative on the best account of\ncreativity and does result in a solution to Pc that is recognizable as a solution to the relevant\ncommunity in extermal combinatorics. In this way, the success represents a displacement of\ndisciplinary creativity rather than an instance of it.\n5\nDiscussion\nIt is important to note that the very same framework discussed in Section 4.2 is a general\nframework that has been applied to completely different problems in mathematics. That is,\nthe approach is not an approach to solving any particular problem at all. If we take seriously\nthe idea that resources drawn on in the exercise of mathematical creativity vary from problem\nto problem, then an approach that is indifferent to the particularities of any given problem\nrepresents a departure from the computational exercise of disciplinary creativity observed\nin case of the 4CT. The result is an approach to problem-solving that is both powerful and\ndetached. Like the many technological advances that have troubled philosophers in the past,\nit powerful in the sense that it is likely to vastly extend our capacities. Yet, unlike those many\ntechnological advances, it is likely to not only further push humans away from the center of the\nepistemological enterprise, but to simultaneously displace disciplinary creativity and expertise\nfrom the center of our scientific problem-solving strategies.\nReferences\n[ADF+23]\nRohan Anil, Andrew M Dai, Orhan Firat, Melvin Johnson, Dmitry Lepikhin,\nAlexandre Passos, Siamak Shakeri, Emanuel Taropa, Paige Bailey, Zhifeng Chen,\net al.

Core Content and Main Contributions of the Paper\n\nThe paper, **\"AI and the Decentering of Disciplinary Creativity\"**, authored by Eamon Duede from Purdue University and Argonne National Laboratory, centers on the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in scientific problem-solving, particularly its impact on what the author terms **\"disciplinary creativity.\"**\n\n### Core Content:\n- The paper distinguishes between *creative approaches* and *creative products*, introducing a key concept—**disciplinary creativity**: the process of solving problems deemed valuable within a specific academic field through creative methods grounded in that discipline’s specialized knowledge.\n- The author conducts a comparative analysis using two mathematical case studies:\n  - **The Four Color Theorem (4CT)**: Solved with computer assistance but still led by human mathematicians’ creative reasoning—this represents an **extension** rather than replacement of disciplinary creativity;\n  - **The Cap Set Problem Breakthrough**: Achieved via large language models (LLMs) generating code autonomously, without deep human engagement in mathematical reasoning—this exemplifies the **displacement of disciplinary creativity**.\n- The central argument is that while AI significantly enhances our ability to solve complex problems, it risks **decentering** humans and traditional domain expertise from the core of scientific inquiry, potentially altering or even undermining the intrinsic value of scientific research.\n\n### Key Contributions:\n1. **A Philosophical Definition of \"Disciplinary Creativity\"**: The paper situates creativity within specific disciplinary contexts, emphasizing that true creativity requires not only novelty and value but also the application of field-specific knowledge.\n2. **Revealing the Phenomenon of \"Creative Displacement\" by AI**: It highlights how certain AI systems can produce valuable outputs without engaging in authentic disciplinary practices—effectively bypassing the cognitive structures of the field.\n3. **A New Framework for Evaluating AI's Role in Research**: Beyond assessing whether results are correct or novel, the framework emphasizes examining whether the *process* reflects genuine disciplinary creativity.\n\n---\n\n## 2. What Are the Breakthroughs or Innovations in This Paper?\n\nThis paper offers significant theoretical innovation and practical insight at the intersection of philosophy and AI:\n\n### Key Breakthroughs and Innovations:\n\n| Innovation Dimension | Specific Contributions |\n|----------------------|------------------------|\n| **Conceptual Innovation** | Introduces the composite concept of **\"disciplinary creativity\"** with a clear operational definition (creativity + domain expertise + recognition of problem significance), filling a critical gap between philosophical theories of creativity and AI applications. |\n| **Deep Critique of AI’s Role in Science** | Moves beyond the simplistic debate of “Can AI replace scientists?” to ask deeper questions: **Who or what is creating? How is creation happening? Why does this kind of creation matter?** It argues that even valid AI-generated results may lack cognitive ownership and continuity with disciplinary traditions. |\n| **Historical Analogy for Persuasive Depth** | Draws a compelling parallel between Socrates’ critique of writing (as a threat to memory and wisdom) and today’s concerns about AI as a form of “cognitive outsourcing,” enriching technological reflection with philosophical depth. |\n| **Distinguishing Two Models of Computational Research** | Clearly differentiates between **mechanized mathematical creativity** (e.g., 4CT proof) and **algorithmic search detached from disciplinary centers** (e.g., Cap Set solution), offering a new typology for understanding AI’s level of integration into science. |\n| **Anticipating a Shift in Scientific Paradigms** | Proposes that AI is enabling a rise in **universal problem-solving frameworks**—systems that operate independently of domain-specific knowledge, relying instead on feedback loops to optimize outputs. These represent a fundamentally **detached** mode of problem-solving. |\n\n> 🔍 Notably, the author does not oppose AI in science; rather, he warns that when AI no longer reflects human disciplinary intelligence, we may gain efficiency at the cost of losing science as a **distinctly human intellectual pursuit**.\n\n---\n\n## 3.
