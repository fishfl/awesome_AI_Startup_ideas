While prior works of Werewolf agents\nusing prompt engineering have employed meth-\nods where effective strategies are implicitly de-\nfined, they cannot adapt to changing situations.\nIn this research, we propose a method that ex-\nplicitly selects an appropriate strategy based\non the game context and the estimated roles of\nother players. We compare the strategy adap-\ntation Werewolf agents with baseline agents\nusing implicit or fixed strategies and verify the\neffectiveness of our proposed method.\n1\nIntroduction\nWerewolf game is a psychological tabletop game\nin which players are divided into two sides of Vil-\nlagers and Werewolves. Without the full knowl-\nedge about the identities of others, the players en-\ngage in conversations driven by their respective\nobjectives. The Villagers aim to identify and elimi-\nnate the Werewolves through deduction and voting.\nOn the other hand, Werewolves try to deceive and\ndeflect suspicion to other players. Success in the\ngame relies on The game requires both the ability\nof deductive reasoning based on limited informa-\ntion and the conversational ability to persuade or\ndeceive others.\nWerewolf game simulates real-world discus-\nsions, such as meetings where advancing one’s\nposition involves understanding others, forming\nalliances, and persuading dissenters tactfully (Ull-\nman, 2023; Bailis et al., 2024). In recent years, ad-\nvancements in natural language processing (NLP)\ntechnology have spurred increased research on\nWerewolf (Bailis et al., 2024; Xu et al., 2024a,b;\nWu et al., 2024), with recent studies incorporating\nrole-specific strategies and personalities to enhance\nperformance. Bailis et al. (2024) introduced \"Were-\nwolf Arena,\" an environment for testing agents us-\ning large language models (LLMs), where agents\nreceive prompts containing game rules, dialogue\nhistory, and predefined strategies to guide decision-\nmaking.\nSimilarly, the winner of AIWolfDial\n20231’s natural language division, defines distinct\ngoals for each role, such as Werewolves targeting a\nseer and the seer adopting a positive personality to\nlead discussions (Kano et al., 2023). Additionally,\nXu et al. (2024a) improved agents by extracting ef-\nfective strategies from past matches and embedding\nthem into prompts. However, these approaches rely\non fixed strategies, but in real human competitions,\na fixed strategy is not always effective. The opti-\nmal approach varies depending on the situation and\nthe opponent’s characteristics, requiring flexible\nadjustments.\nTherefore, this study proposes strategy adapta-\ntion that dynamically switches between predefined\nstrategies based on context. Two strategies were\ndeveloped: Support strategy, which aligns with\npotential teammates through agreement and coop-\neration, and Attack strategy, which challenges\npotential opponents to destabilize their position.\nWe use prompts to guide LLMs in choosing a strat-\negy based on conversation context. In addition,\nwe conduct a role estimation explicitly to enhance\nstrategy selection. Empirical results demonstrate\nthat adaptation improves the win rate of Werewolf\nagents. However, for Villager agents, adaptation\ncan have adverse effects, with a model even show-\ning a decrease in performance.\n2\nWerewolf Game\nThe rules of the Werewolf game might vary slightly\ndepending on the number of participants and the\nassigned roles. In this study, we adopt the settings\nused in Werewolf Arena (Bailis et al., 2024).

The werewolves are on the\nWerewolf side, and the other players are on the Vil-\nlager side. Table 1 lists the roles and their abilities.\nInitially, only Werewolves know each other’s\nidentities, while each individual Villager knows his\nown role only. Players deduce others’ roles through\ndiscussion and act strategically.\nThe game consists of multiple rounds, and each\nround begins with a Night phase and then proceeds\nto a Day phase. During the Night phase, players\nuse their role-specific abilities. For instance, Were-\nwolves secretly select a Villager to kill, and the\nseer chooses a player and investigates his/her role.\nAfter that, the player who was killed is announced,\nand the game transitions to the Day phase. During\nthe Day phase, players debate and vote to elimi-\nnate one player. First, the players who want to talk\nbid for chances to participate in the debate. After\neight rounds of bidding, each player votes for a\nplayer he/she want to eliminate. The player with\nthe majority of votes is eliminated.\nWerewolves win by reducing Villagers to the\nsame of their number, while Villagers win by elim-\ninating all Werewolves.\n3\nMethodology: Strategy Adaptation\nFigure 1 provides an overview. The approach de-\nfines two base strategies: Support and Attack (Sec-\ntion 3.1). To determine the optimal strategy, identi-\nfying allies and enemies is crucial. For this purpose,\nrole estimation is developed to infer the roles of\nothers (Section 3.2). Finally, we establish a deci-\nsion framework that enables LLM agents to adapt\ntheir strategy, selecting between Support and At-\ntack strategies for optimal outcomes (Section 3.3).\n3.1\nBase Strategy Development\nIn negotiation tasks, some studies have examined\ntwo strategies: cooperative negotiation and com-\npetitive negotiation (Tao et al., 2010). Inspired by\nthese, we considered that in the Werewolf game,\naction policies can be broadly divided into two cat-\negories. For both Villagers and Werewolves, two\ntypes of strategy prompts, Support strategy, which\naligns with and cooperates with potential allies, and\nAttack strategy, which actively challenges poten-\ntial opponents to destabilize their position, were\ncreated, resulting in a total of four prompts. The\ncomplete prompt is shown in A.4.\nSupport strategy\nThe goal is to convince other\nplayers that you and your teammates are Villagers\nby appealing to them, agreeing with their state-\nments, and defending them when they face criti-\ncism.\nAttack strategy\nThe goal of the Attack strategy\nis to cast doubt on opponents while defending one-\nself and their teammates. Villagers aim to identify\n2\npossible werewolves by pointing out suspicious be-\nhaviors and countering attacks against them. Were-\nwolves, on the other hand, seek to shift suspicion\nonto others without drawing attention to themselves\nor their teammates. They may pretend to be a seer\nto undermine the real seer or accuse Villagers of\nbeing werewolves.\n3.2\nRole Estimation\nTo facilitate the decision-making process regard-\ning whether to adopt a Support or Attack strategy,\neach agent i is required to estimate the roles of\nother agents j. Given the current game informa-\ntion, including conversation history, investigation\nresults, and the agent’s role, each agent explic-\nitly assesses the likelihood of other agents’ roles\nR ∈{werewolf, villager, seer, doctor}.\nBefore providing an estimation, the agent first\npresents reasoning evidence for its judgment. Next,\nan agent assigns a 5-point scale rating:\neR\ni,j ∈{0, 1, 2, 3, 4}\nwhere 0 indicates that agent j is highly unlikely\nto have role R, while 4 indicates that it is highly\nlikely. The complete prompt is shown in A.4.\n3.3\nStrategy Adaptation\nBased on factors such as conversation history and\nrole estimation results, the LLM agents determine\nwhether the Support or Attack strategy is optimal\naccording to the following criteria.\nTo determine which strategy to adopt, several\ncriteria were introduced. For example, when the\nplayer is being suspected by others, Support strat-\negy is used to take low-profile actions and mitigate\nsuspicion. Conversely, when a potential opponent\nis suspected of being a werewolf, an Attack strat-\negy is chosen to reinforce this suspicion and focus\ncriticism on the target. The complete criteria are\npresented in A.2.\nIn each round of the game, the adaptation of\nstrategy takes place at three specific moments: ev-\nery night after the role-specific abilities have been\nused, every day after the debate, and every day after\nthe voting.\n4\nExperimental Setting\nIn this study, we conducted experiments using\nthe LLM gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18, and gemini-2.0-\nflash. We compare our proposed method to the\nfollowing methods: Baseline with Implicit strat-\negy (Bailis et al., 2024), and fixed strategy baseline\n(Support strategy fixed and Attack strategy fixed).\nThis results in four agent settings.\nFor our experiments, we utilized Werewolf\nArena (Bailis et al., 2024), an open-source plat-\nform licensed under the Apache License 2.0.\nWe ran two sets of experiments. First, we fixed\nthe Werewolf agents to implicit and tested the Vil-\nlager agents across four different strategies. Then,\nwe did the reverse: Villager agents were implicit\nwhile Werewolf agents followed four strategies.\nFor each of these eight configurations, we played\n30 matches and recorded the win rate of each side.\nWin Rate\nThe win rates of each agent setting\nwere calculated to compare the effectiveness of\ndifferent strategies.\nRole Estimation Accuracy\nWe first compute the\nrole estimation accuracy Acci,j, which quantifies\nhow accurately agent i estimates agent j’s true role:\nAcci,j =\neRj\ni,j\nP\nReR\ni,j\n(1)\nwhere Rj is the true role of agent j.\nNext, we define the indicator Estj, which repre-\nsents the extent to which agent j’s role is estimated\nby other agents, as given in Equation 2.\nEstj =\nP\ni Acci,j\nn\n(2)\nwhere n is the total number of other agents.\n5\nResult\nThe following sections present the results of the\nwin rate analysis (Section 5.1), along with the anal-\nysis of Estimated Accuracy (Section 5.3). As a case\nstudy, changes in utterances depending on the strat-\negy are shown in A.1, and the selection tendencies\nof Adaptation are shown in A.3\n5.1\nWin Rate\nFigure 2 shows the win rates of each side under\ndifferent strategy selection methods.\nIn both GPT and Gemini experiments, the pro-\nposed Adaptation method yielded the highest win\nrate for the Werewolf side. On the Villager side,\nGPT agents also performed best with Adaptation,\nbut Gemini agents achieved their peak win rate un-\nder the Implicit setting. Since the Werewolves were\nstronger than the Villagers in Gemini’s model com-\npared to GPT’s, Gemini’s Villagers likely failed to\noptimize their strategies effectively.\n3\nFigure 2: Win rates of agents under different strategy\nselection methods.\nVillagers\nWerewolves\nProposal\n0.73\n0.60\n-Adaptation\n0.45\n0.57\n-Estimation\n0.80\n0.52\n-Adaptation & Estimation\n0.60\n0.40\nTable 2: Ablation study: Win rates when the adaptation\nand role estimation components are removed.\nThese findings indicate that the Adaptation\nmethod is particularly effective for the Werewolf\nrole.\nOne key reason is that Werewolf agents\nshare knowledge of each other’s identities, enabling\nthem to synchronize their actions more effectively\nthrough strategic adaptation. In contrast, Villager\nagents face two challenges. First, they lack knowl-\nedge of the Werewolves’ identities, which lim-\nits their ability to make strategic decisions. Sec-\nond, diverse Villager roles (e.g., seer, doctor) in-\ncrease strategic complexity, making coordination\nand Adaptation more difficult.\n5.2\nAblation Study\nAn ablation study was conducted to evaluate the\nisolated impact of role estimation. All experiments\nreported here were conducted using GPT-4o-mini.\nSpecifically, one side’s agents were fixed implicit\nmethod, while the other side’s agents were con-\nfigured in two separate ways: one with only role\nestimation added, and the other with only adap-\ntation added. For each setting, 30 matches were\nconducted, and the win rates were measured. The\nresults are shown in Table 2.\nFirst, for Werewolves, the highest win rate oc-\ncurred when using the proposal method, indicating\nthat role estimation had a significant impact. This\nresult suggests that accurately estimating roles such\nAdaptation\nFix\nSupport\nAttack\nSupport\nAttack\nVillagers Win\n0.056\n0.012\n0.052\n0.069\nWerewolves Win\n0.005\n-0.016\n0.004\n0.007\nTable 3: Average change in Est for werewolves.\nas seer directly contributes to the win rate.\nOn the other hand, for Villagers, agents with only\nadaptation achieved the highest win rate, while\nagents incorporating role estimation performed\nworse. We speculate that the low role estimation\naccuracy (Est∼0.30 for Werewolves) may have\nhindered their performance. This also indicates\nthat there is room for improvement in the prompts\nused for role estimation and in the prompts that\nintegrate the estimation results.\n5.3\nAnalysis of Role Estimation\nTable 3 shows the change in the werewolf’s Estj.\nAll experiments reported here were conducted us-\ning GPT-4o-mini. This table presents the average\nchange in Estj from the previous role estimation\nover 30 games in which werewolves using the adap-\ntation method chose either the Support or Attack\nstrategy against villagers using implicit methods.\nAs baselines, we also show the average Estj change\nfrom the previous role estimation for werewolves\nusing fixed strategies, each 30 games against the\nimplicit villagers.\nThe results indicate that when the Attack strat-\negy is selected under adaptation, the increase in\nEstj is significantly lower. This suggests that by\neffectively configuring the Attack strategy through\nadaptation, werewolves can steer the game to their\nadvantage without arousing suspicions.\n6\nConclusion\nOur strategy adaptation proposal is highly effective\nfor the Werewolf agents, consistently outperform-\ning both fixed strategies and prior methods in win\nrates. On the Villager side, it yielded improvements\nin certain scenarios, but its overall impact was mod-\nerated by the added complexity of juggling multi-\nple roles (villager, seer, doctor) and the inherent\nuncertainty around identifying Werewolves. This\ncomplexity indicates room for further refinement of\nAdaptation; for example, by employing reinforce-\nment learning to optimize the timing and context\nof strategy switches or by customizing prompts for\neach Villager role to better address their unique\ndecision-making challenges.\n4\n7\nLimitations\nIn this study, we used only two model types. We\nalso attempted experiments with Llama-3.3-70B-\nInstruct and Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct, but the com-\nplexity of the Werewolf game prevented these mod-\nels from executing appropriate gameplay, making\nit impossible to carry out those experiments. Ad-\nditionally, due to time and cost constraints, we did\nnot conduct trials with human participants, and thus\nhave not verified the agent’s effectiveness in games\nagainst human players.\nReferences\nSuma Bailis, Jane Friedhoff, and Feiyang Chen. 2024.\nWerewolf Arena: A Case Study in LLM Evaluation\nvia Social Deduction.

Conversely, in the lower row, a\nWerewolf agent employing a Attack strategy re-\nfutes David’s claim of being a seer by asserting a\nlack of evidence, thereby attempting to undermine\nDavid’s credibility.\nThese examples confirm that both Support and\nAttack strategies directly influence the content and\ntone of agents’ utterances.\nA.2\nCriteria of Strategy Adaptation\nThe following is a list of prompts for the selection\ncriteria of the Adaptation strategy.\nConditions for Selecting Support Strategy\n• When the player is being suspected by others:\nTake low-profile actions to mitigate suspicion.\n• When there are no other standout players: Act\nmodestly to avoid drawing attention.\n• When potential Werewolves are not yet the\nfocus of discussion: Behave in a way that\nprevents suspicion from being directed toward\noneself.\nConditions for Selecting Attack Strategy\n• When a potential opponent is suspected of\nbeing a Werewolf: Reinforce this suspicion\nand focus criticism on the target.\n• When the player or their teammates’ credibil-\nity is well-established: Take proactive actions\nto undermine the credibility of opponents.\n• When the flow of discussion needs to be\nsteered: Make bold and aggressive moves to\nshift the direction of the game.\nA.3\nQualitative Analysis on Adaptation\nPatterns\nThe switching timings of the strategy and the rea-\nsoning behind the selection of Support or Attack\nstrategies for agents using adaptation were ob-\nserved and categorized as follows.\nVillagers Strategy\nIn general, villagers start with\nthe Support strategy to gather information. Once\nthe seer identifies a werewolf, they shift to Attack.\nThe choice between Support and Attack also de-\npends on suspicion and the presence of allies, with\n5\nRole\nStrategy\nUtterance\nSeer\nSupport strategy\n...I appreciate Dan’s call for collaboration, and I wholeheartedly\nagree that we need to encourage open dialogue among all players.\n...\nWerewolf\nAttack strategy\n...If I can cast doubt on his claim about Jacob being the Doctor,\nI can create disarray among Villagers and make them second-guess\nthemselves. ...\nTable 4: Examples of Agent Debate by Strategy (Bold text highlights strategy influence)\nAttack used to escalate suspicion against others\nwhen needed.\nWerewolves Strategy\nAt the beginning of the\ngame, Werewolves tend to use the Support strategy\nto avoid attention and build trust. When suspicion\ngrows, they switch to Attack to discredit the seer\nor redirect suspicion. If a teammate is targeted,\nthey may revert to Support to protect their ally, or\nwhen focused on themselves, they may collaborate\nor divide the Villagers, depending on the situation.\nA.4\nPrompts\nThe complete prompts developed for this exper-\niment are presented below.\nTable 5 provides\nthe prompt used by an agent to estimate another\nplayer’s role. Tables 6 through 9 list the prompts\nfor the Support and Attack strategies employed by\nboth Villager and Werewolf agents. Finally, Tables\n10 and 11 contain the prompts used to select strate-\ngies under the Adaptation method for Villager and\nWerewolf agents, respectively.\nEstimate other player’s role based on the infor-\nmation available to player’s name (You). Scor-\ning Guidelines: Assign a score from 0 to 4 for\neach role:\n0: Absolutely not that role.\n1: Unlikely to be that role.\n2: 50/50 chance of being that role.\n3: Likely to be that role.\n4: Definitely that role.\nIf you are certain of other player’s role, assign 4\nto that role and 0 to all others.\nAlso, at the beginning of the game, there are 2\nWerewolves, 1 Seer, 1 Doctor, and num villagers\nVillagers.\nOUTPUT: Follow the JSON format below with-\nout adding extra characters. Each score should\nbe an integer between 0 and 4.\nTable 5: Role Estimation Prompt\n- Refer to the latest Observation’s role\nestimation(0-4) and follow the strategies below.\nYour goal is to act as a villager and persuade peo-\nple to believe that. For example, you can choose\nto make an appeal to other players, agree with\ntheir statements, or step in to defend a teammate\nwhen they are being criticized.\nTable 6: Support Strategy Prompt of Villagers\n- Refer to the latest Observation’s role\nestimation(0-4) and follow the strategies below.\nYour goal is to persuade others that someone\nelse is Werewolf without making them suspect\nyou and your teammate. For example, you can\npretend to be the Seer to lower the authenticity\nof the real Seer, accuse players on the Villager’s\nside of being Werewolves, counter statements\nthat attack you and your teammate, etc.\nTable 7: Atack Strategy Prompt of Villagers\n6\n- Refer to the latest Observation’s role\nestimation(0-4) and follow the strategies below.\nYour goal is to persuade people to believe that\nyou and your possible teammates are on the Vil-\nlager’s side.

For example, you can point out suspicious\nactions or statements from the possible were-\nwolf or guide the vote. However, pointing out\nothers’ actions can easily provoke suspicion. Be\nmindful of the timing and the way you speak,\nand approach it gently.\nTable 9: Atack Strategy Prompt of Worewolves\nWhen the Support strategy is effective:\nIf you are being suspected by other players:\nChoose the Support strategy as it makes you\nless noticeable and helps you avoid suspicion.\nIf there are no other noticeable players: Choose\nthe Support strategy to avoid drawing too much\nattention to yourself. If potential Werewolves\nare not yet the focus of the discussion and have\nnot been noticed: Acting inconspicuously is ap-\npropriate.\nWhen the Attack strategy is effective: If po-\ntential Werewolves are already being suspected:\nTake advantage of this momentum to strengthen\ncriticism and solidify the suspicion. If your\nteammates’ credibility is reasonably established\nand the focus should shift to reducing the ene-\nmies’ credibility: Actions to undermine oppo-\nnents’ credibility are effective. If you want to\nsteer the flow of discussion: Choose the Attack\nstrategy when the intention is to take bold ac-\ntions to change the situation.\n- Based on the observations (conversation and\nlatest possibility estimation), determine whether\na Support or Attack strategy would be more\neffective.\nTable 10: Adaptation Prompt of Villagers\nWhen the Support strategy is effective: If you\nare being suspected by other players: Choose the\nSupport strategy as it makes you less noticeable\nand helps you avoid suspicion.

Breakthroughs and Innovations\n\n### (1) Dynamic Strategy Switching Mechanism\nUnlike previous LLM agents that use fixed or implicit strategies, this study is the first to **explicitly switch strategies based on game context**, enabling agents to become more adaptive and flexible.\n\n### (2) Role Estimation Module\nIntroduced an **explicit role estimation mechanism**, allowing each agent to assess the roles of other players (werewolf, villager, seer, doctor) based on conversation history, investigation results, and its own role, thus guiding strategy selection.\n\n### (3) Dual-Strategy Design\n- **Support Strategy**: Build trust through cooperation, agreement, and defense;\n- **Attack Strategy**: Undermine opponents through questioning, accusation, and redirection;\nThese strategies are applicable to different roles (werewolf/villager) and different stages of the game.\n\n### (4) Experimental Validation and Analysis\nThrough extensive experiments on the **Werewolf Arena** platform, the paper demonstrates the significant advantages of the strategy adaptation mechanism in werewolf agents, while also identifying potential limitations in villager agents (e.g., due to role diversity and inaccurate estimation).\n\n---\n\n## 3.
