By providing a unified\nrepresentation, Agent Spec enables seamless portability and interoperability of agents across diverse\nframeworks, ensuring consistent behavior and execution across various AI Agent frameworks. Agent\nSpec serves as an abstraction layer above framework-specific specifications, acting as a unifying layer\nthat encapsulates agent functionality beyond individual framework constraints.\n1.1\nBackground & Motivation\nExisting agentic frameworks have their own strengths and limitations. While flexibility is crucial to\naccommodating diverse agentic design patterns, currently available frameworks do not fully support\nall of them. Table 1 outlines key objectives a comprehensive framework should cover and describes\nhow Agent Spec addresses each of these requirements.\nMoreover, different frameworks are usually parameterized and configured by different means. This\nmakes porting solutions between frameworks a tedious and error-prone process, hindering collab-\noration and knowledge sharing among teams developing agentic applications. Consequently, a\ndeclarative, portable, and framework-agnostic representation of agentic designs is needed.\narXiv:2510.04173v2  [cs.AI]  7 Oct 2025\nTable 1: Challenges and objectives in agentic frameworks and solutions that we define with Agent\nSpec.\nTopic\nObjective\nOpen Agent Specification\nAgents\nAuthor and edit conversational solutions\nsuch as ReAct [12] style agents.\nAbility to define components that represent \"resources\"\n(with no impact on conversation flow routing) such as\nLLMs, memory, prompt templates, tools, other Agents\nwhich can be attached to other components’ properties.\nFlows\nAuthor and edit graph-style workflows\nsuch as multi-step business processes.\nAbility to define components that have a well-defined\nexecution path such as a directed graph which may\ncontain conditional routes or loops.\nControl flow routing\nAbility to define the flow of execution\nbetween components in the system,\nincluding conditional or looping flows.\nExplicit \"relationships\" (edges) for control flow\nsupporting one-to-many and many-to-one transitions. The\nspecific transition to be taken is determined at\nruntime for a given execution.\nI/O routing\nAbility to define which outputs are\nconsumed by which inputs for fixed\nflow components. This includes\nconditional or looping flows, and outputs\nthat are consumed in multiple places.\nExplicit \"relationships\" (edges) for data flow.

Provision of components for\ndefining an element and for using them.\nFor example, an Agent component to define agent and\nan AgentNode in a Flow to use it in a certain place,\nor a Tool component to define a tool and a ToolNode\nin a Flow to use the tool in a specific place.\nFor instance, ONNX [8] has revolutionized deep learning by providing a consistent way to port ML\nmodels across different frameworks (e.g., PyTorch [9], TensorFlow [11]). Similarly, Agent Spec aims\nto establish a unified representation for AI agents, enabling seamless interoperability and execution\nacross diverse agentic frameworks. Just as ONNX allows models to be trained in one framework and\nexecuted in another, Agent Spec allows AI agents to be designed once and deployed across multiple\nplatforms without reimplementation.\n1.2\nObjectives of Open Agent Specification\nAgent Spec aims to define a common representation and act as a superset of capabilities for AI agents\nand workflows. Agent Spec graphs can be executed in different frameworks by means of runtimes\nthat map Agent Spec components to the underlying framework’s primitives. Agent Spec, along with\nimporters and exporters for various underlying frameworks, enables transparent portability of agent\nworkflows. Agent Spec also provides methods to validate agent workflows before execution, ensuring\nthey are syntactically and logically correct and executable.\n1.3\nKey Benefits of Agent Spec\n1.3.1\nPortability & Reusability\n• Framework-Agnostic: Agent Spec abstracts agent definitions from specific implementa-\ntions by providing a unified declarative representation, allowing agents to operate uniformly\nacross multiple platforms (e.g., AutoGen, LangGraph, OCI Agents) without any need for\nreimplementation.\n• Modular Design: Agent Spec’s component-based structure fosters reusability and extensi-\nbility, enabling enterprises to build complex agentic systems by assembling and configuring\nstandardized components.\n2\n• Support for Complex Agentic Flows: Agent Spec facilitates the creation of intricate agentic\nworkflows by supporting various modular components and reusable Agent Spec-defined\npatterns, enabling streamlined development of advanced AI agent systems.\n• Portable Execution Graphs: Agent Spec enables execution graphs to be described in a way\nthat is independent of the underlying runtime implementation, ensuring seamless portability\nacross frameworks. Converters between the representations of other frameworks to Agent\nSpec would simplify the porting of previously developed agents to Agent Spec-compatible\nframeworks.\n1.3.2\nInteroperability & Compatibility\n• SDK Support: Agent Spec provides SDKs in various programming languages (starting\nwith Python), supporting serialization and deserialization of agents into Agent Spec con-\nfigurations. This simplifies development, deployment, and debugging across different\nenvironments.\n• Robustness & Consistency: Agents defined in Agent Spec can be built on top of compo-\nnents that have been defined and validated within the Agent Spec specification, leading to\nhigher reliability and predictability.\n• Define Once, Run on Multiple Frameworks: Agentic systems leveraging Agent Spec\ncan run on various frameworks through runtime adapters. Agent Spec’s open specification\nallows developers to implement these adapters to support any framework, enabling agents to\nrun in optimized environments.\n1.3.3\nUnification across Frameworks\n• Common Format: Agent Spec’s common format simplifies integration of agents and\nenables easier agent sharing across platforms.\n• Knowledge Exchange: The unified declarative format that Agent Spec provides helps\ndevelopers as well as maintainers of agents to efficiently exchange solutions and ideas.\n• Conformance Test Suite: The Agent Spec conformance test suite offers a comprehensive\nset of tests that cover the various functionalities and components available within the\nspecification, such as Agent, Flow, and ToolNode. It includes illustrative validation examples\nof Agent Spec YAML configurations and verifies that these configurations produce consistent\nexecution outcomes and behaviors across multiple runtime environments. This approach\nensures interoperability and correctness of implementations supporting the Agent Spec\nspecification.\n2\nOpen Agent Specification Design\nThis section provides an overview of Agent Spec’s declarative model. It details how Agent Spec\nfunctions across different frameworks and outlines implementation specifics, including the SDK\nstructure, supported programming languages, agent definition using the SDK, and the serialization/de-\nserialization of agents and workflows.\nAgent Spec is intended to be a portable, platform-agnostic configuration language that allows agents\nand agentic systems to be described with sufficient fidelity. It defines the conceptual objects, called\ncomponents, that compose agents in typical agentic systems, including the properties that determine\nthe components’ configuration, and their respective semantics.\nRuntimes implement the Agent Spec components for execution with agentic frameworks or libraries.\nAgent Spec would be supported by SDKs in various languages (e.g., Python), enabling serialization\nand deserialization of Agents to YAML, or creating them from object representations with assurance\nof conformance to the specification.\nAn outline of the components involved in the Agent Spec ecosystem is depicted in Fig. 1.\n3\nTable 2: Agent Spec aims to do for AI agents what ONNX did for ML models\nFeature\nONNX (ML Models)\nAgent Spec (AI Agents)\nScope\nUnified representation of\nML models, allowing portability\nacross different deep learning\nframeworks.\nUnified representation of AI agents\nand workflows, enabling them to\nrun across diverse agentic frameworks.\nPortability\nONNX allows ML models to be\ntrained in one framework (e.g.,\nPyTorch, TensorFlow) and\nexecuted in another.\nAgent Spec enables AI agents to be built in\none framework (e.g., LangGraph [10], AutoGen [6],\nOCI Agents [4]) and run in another without modification.\nUnification\nProvides a common declarative\nformat which is versioned as\nan Opset.\nProvides a common agent\nconfiguration format.\nExtensibility\nSupports various ML\noperations and optimizations\nDefines modular components for scalable agent systems.\nFigure 1: Agent Spec’s Design\n2.1\nOverview of Agent Specification\nThe Open Agent Specification defines structure and behavior of the conceptual building blocks, called\ncomponents, that make up agents in typical agent-based systems. This structure can be serialized into\na serialization language, like JSON or YAML. An overview of the language specification of Agent\nSpec follows, while the full specification can be accessed at https://oracle.github.io/agent\n-spec/agentspec/language_spec_25_4_1.html.\n2.2\nComponents\nIn Agent Spec, components are the building blocks which cover the commonly used elements in\nagentic systems, such as (but not limited to) LLMs and tools.\nDescribing these components with specific types enables:\n• Type safety + Usage hints for GUIs\n– Example: if a component’s property is expecting an LLM, only allow LLMs to be\nconnected to it.\n– Example: highlight valid connections from one component to others in a graphical\nprogramming interface for agents.\n• Static analysis + validation\n– Examples: if a component is a Flow, it must have a start node. If a component is an\nAgent, it must have an LLM.\n• Ease of programmatic use\n– Component families each have corresponding class definitions in the Agent Spec SDK.\nThis allows consumers (agent execution environments, editing GUIs) to utilize concrete\nclasses, rather than having to implicitly understand which type has which properties.\n4\n2.2.1\nBase Component\nThe basic block in Agent Spec is a Component, which by itself can be used to describe any instance\nof any type, guaranteeing flexibility to adapt to future changes.\nNote that Agent Spec does not need to encapsulate the implementation code it describes; it simply\nneeds to be able to express enough information to instantiate a uniquely identifiable object of a\nspecific type with a specific set of property values.\nA metadata field contains all additional information that could be useful in different usages of\nthe Agent Specification. For example, GUIs will require including some information about the\ncomponents (e.g., position coordinates, size, color, notes, ...), so that they will be able to visualize\nthem properly even after an export-import process. Metadata is optional and set to null by default.\nSymbolic references (configuration components)\nWhen a component references another compo-\nnent entity (for example as a property value), there is a simple symbolic syntax to accomplish this,\n\"$component_ref:\" followed by the id of the other component.\nThis type of relationship is applicable to both Agent components as well as Flow components (a fixed\nflow component may also use an LLM or memory component).\nWe do not need a separate object for this type of reference, as the reference is explicitly assigned to\nsome property or parameter.\n1 \"$component_ref:{COMPONENT_ID}\"\nInput/output schemas\nComponents might need some input data to perform their task and expose\nsome output as result. These inputs and outputs must be declared and described in Agent Spec, so\nthat users, developers and other components of the agent are aware of what is exposed as inputs and\noutputs respectively. Note that we do not add input/output schemas directly to the base Component\nclass, as there are a few cases where they do not really apply (for example LLMConfig and edges,\nplease see the next sections).\nInput and output properties\nInput and output schemas are used to define which values the different\ncomponents accept as input or provide as output. We call these values \"properties\".\nThe term \"properties\" originates from JSON schema [5]. In the Agent Spec specification, we rely on\nthis widely accepted and consolidated format. For more information about JSON schema definition,\nplease check the official website at https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema.\nIn Agent Spec, a valid schema requires specific attributes:\n• title: the name of the property\n• type: the type of the property, following the type system described below\nAdditionally, users can specify:\n• default: the default value of this property\n• description: a textual description for the property\nThese are the minimal set of attributes (or annotations, as per JSON schema terminology) that we\nrequire to be supported for Agent Spec compatibility.\nType system\nWe rely on the typing system defined by the JSON schema format (see https:\n//json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/type). At its core, JSON\nSchema defines the basic types available in most programming languages, though they may go by\ndifferent names.\nInputs and outputs of nested components\nIn case of nested components (for example using an\nAgent component inside a Flow, or a Flow inside another Flow, or just a step in a Flow), the wrapping\ncomponent is supposed to expose a (sub)set of the inputs/outputs provided by the inner components\ntogether with additional inputs/outputs it might generate as shown in Fig. 2. We require to replicate\n5\nFigure 2: Inputs and outputs of nested components, as well as those of their wrapping component\nthe JSON schema of each value in the inputs/outputs lists of every component that exposes it, hence,\nif a wrapper component exposes some inputs and outputs of some of its internal components, it\nwill have to include them in its own list of inputs/outputs as well. This makes the specification of\nthe components a bit more verbose, but clearer and more readable. Parsers of the specification are\nrequired to ensure the consistency of the input/output schemas defined in it.\nIn the example above the wrapping Flow component (see sections below for more details about\nFlows) requires two inputs that coincide with two of the inputs exposed by the nested components\nand exposes one output among those exposed by the inner components in addition to one it computes\nitself.\nValidation of specified inputs/outputs\nSome input and output schemas are automatically generated\nby components based on their configuration. However, for the sake of clarity and readability of\nAgent Spec, we require that the descriptions of inputs and outputs are always reported in the Agent\nSpecification. Consequently, when a serialized specification is read and imported by a runtime or\nan SDK, the inputs and outputs configuration of each component must be validated against the one\ngenerated by its configuration (if any).\nSpecifying inputs through placeholders\nSome components might infer inputs from special parts of\ntheir attributes. For example, some nodes (e.g., the LLMNode) extract inputs from their configuration\nattributes, so that their values can be adapted based on previous computations We let users define\nplaceholders in some attributes, by simply wrapping the name of the property among a double set\nof curly brackets. The node automatically infers the inputs by interpreting those configurations\nand the actual value of the input/output will be replaced at execution time. Whether an attribute\naccepts placeholders depends on the definition of the component itself. For example, setting the\nprompt_template configuration of an LLMNode to \"You are a great assistant. Please help the user\nwith this request: {{request}}\" will generate an input called \"request\" of type string.\n2.2.2\nAgent\nThe Agent is the top-level component that holds shared resources such as conversation memory and\ntools. It also represents the entry point for interactions with the agentic system. Its purpose is to fill\nout the values for all the properties defined in the outputs attribute, with or without any interaction\nwith the user.\nIt is important to have a separate definition for Agents as components, so that the same Agent\ncomponent can be reused several times in a Flow or as part of a more complex agent design, without\nreplicating its definition multiple times.\n2.2.3\nLLM\nLarge Language Models (LLM) are used in agents as generative models. To embed them into the\nagent, they need to be configurable flexibly with configuration parameters like the connection details,\nmodel id, the generation parameters, and more.\nBy default, only the generation parameters used when prompting the LLM must be specified. Specific\nextensions of LLMConfig for the most common model providers can be derived.\n6\nIndeed, this is not limited to locally hosted models; in principle, it also enables the configuration of\nAPI endpoints such as those provided by OpenAI, Anthropic, Mistral, and others.\n2.2.4\nTool\nA tool is a procedural function or a Flow that can be made available to an Agent component to\nexecute and perform tasks. The Agent component can decide to call a tool based on its signature and\ndescription. In a fixed Flow context, a node would need to be configured to call a specific tool.\nIn Agent Spec, we differentiate tools according to where the actual functionality is executed or run\nand specify three corresponding types:\n• ServerTools are executed in the same runtime environment where the agent is being executed.\nThe definitions of these tools therefore must be available to the agent’s environment. It is\nexpected that this type of tool will be limited in number, and generally in functionality.\n• ClientTools are not executed by the runtime. The client environment must execute the tool\nand provide the results back to the runtime (like OpenAI’s function calling model).\n• RemoteTools are run in an external environment and are triggered by an RPC or REST call\nfrom the agent runtime.\nAgent Spec is not supposed to provide an implementation of how these types of tools should work\nbut provides their representation, so that they can be correctly interpreted and ported across platforms\nand languages. In principle a Tool is a function that is called providing some parameters (i.e., inputs),\nperforms some transformation, and returns the result (i.e., outputs). The function has a name, and a\ndescription that can be used by an LLM for context when it is relevant to perform a task. Therefore,\nwe define Tool as an extension of ComponentWithIO.\nTools may specify multiple outputs. In this case, the expected return value of the tool is a dictionary\nwhere each entry corresponds to an element specified in the output. The key of the dictionary entry\nmust match the name of the property specified in the output. The runtime should parse the dictionary\nto extract the different outputs and bind them correctly. While ServerTool and ClientTool do not\nrequire specific additional parameters, the\nRemoteTool requires including also the details needed to invoke the remote tool call.\nAn important security consideration for Agent Spec is the exclusion of arbitrary code from the agent\nspecification. The specification is limited to a comprehensive description of the tool—including its\nattributes, inputs, outputs, and other relevant details—but does not contain any executable code.\n2.2.5\nFlow\nFlows (or graphs) are directed, potentially cyclic workflows. They can be thought of as \"subroutines\"\nthat encapsulate consistently repeatable processes. As such, they provide more determinism and\nreliability compared to puristic Agent components at the cost of flexibility.\nFlows are executable as tools by Agent components. Each Flow requires 0 or more inputs (any\ninput edges expressed on the starting node of the graph) and may produce 0 or more outputs (any\noutput edges expressed by the terminal node of the graph - note that a graph can have more than one\nterminal node, in the case of branching logic). As such, the I/O surface of a Flow is directly mutually\nexchangeable with that of a tool.\nFlow objects specify the the directed graph’s entry point, nodes, and edges. Components inherent in\nthe Flow are described in subsequent sections.\nA Flow exposes the set of outputs that are available in all EndNode objects, and all inputs that are\ndefined in its StartNode.\nRelationships / Edges\nFor Flows, Agent Spec defines separate relationships (edges) for both\nproperties and control flow. This allows Agent Spec to unambiguously handle patterns such as\nconditional branches and loops, which are challenging to support with data-only flow control.\nRelations are only applicable for Flows. All relations express a transition from some source node to\nsome target node.\n7\n(a) Control flow with two branches that converge into the same node with a property filled based on\nthe branch taken\n(b) Control flow with a self-loop and a property updated by consequent execution of the same node\nFigure 3: Possible connections formed by ControlFlowEdges and DataFlowEdges. ControlFlowEdges\nare shown as solid lines, DataFlowEdges with dotted lines.\n2.2.6\nControlFlowEdge\nA control relationship defines a potential transition from one branch of a node to another. The actual\ntransition to be taken during a given execution is defined by the implementation of a specific node.\nThe from_branch attribute of a ControlFlowEdge is set to null by default, which means that it\nwill connect the default branch (i.e., “next” ) of the source node.\n2.2.7\nDataFlowEdge\nConsidering an I/O system, a component id alone is not sufficient to identify a data relationship. To\nthis purpose, a data relationship is needed to define what output property value should be used to fill\nan input property.\nA component may take multiple input parameters and/or produce multiple output values. We must be\nable to determine what value or reference is mapped to each input and where each output is used.\nDestinations (Inputs of the destination node) can be connected to outputs of another node or to static\nvalues. Sources (Outputs of the source node) can be connected to inputs of another node or left\nunconnected.\nConnecting multiple data edges\nIn the definition of a Flow, it is allowed to connect two or more\ndifferent data outputs to the same input as shown in Fig. 3. The most recently executed node with an\noutput connected to the input takes precedence. In other words, the behavior is like having the input\nexposed as a public variable and every node that has an output connected to that input updates its\nvalue.\nFor the control flow, instead, edges just define which are the allowed \"next step\" transitions: multiple\nconnections from the same outgoing control flow branch are not allowed, and they do not involve any\nambiguity (note that we do not enable parallelism through edges).\nOptionality of data relationships\nSome frameworks do not require specifying the data flow\nexplicitly as they assume that all the properties are publicly exposed in a shared \"variable space\" that\n8\nany component can access, and the read/write strategy is simply name based. In practice, this means\nthat:\n• When a component has an input with a specific name, it will access the public variable space\nto read the value of the variable with that name.\n• When a component has an output with a specific name, it will write (or overwrite if it already\nexists) into the public variable space the variable with that name.\nWe let users adopt this type of I/O system by setting the data_flow_connections parameter of the\nFlow to None. In this case, the name-based approach explained above will be adopted, by using the\nshared variable space described above as the public space where values are published.\nNote that this name-based approach can be expressed by explicitly defining data-flow connections\n(but the opposite is not possible) by connecting all the outputs to the inputs with the same name,\nfollowing the control flow connections in the Flow to account for overwrites.\nFlow state\nWe define as \"flow state\" the set of all values that describe the current stage of execution\nwithin the flow (the point of execution reached). Users have the ability to specify which set of values\nwithin the flow state are publicly exposed to all nodes.\nThese values are treated differently compared to values that are exposed through inputs and outputs\nof nodes:\n• They are always available in every node and do not need to be connected by a\nDataFlowEdge.\n• If a component writes an output which name matches a flow state value, the respective value\nin the flow state is overwritten.\nConversation\nAt the core of the execution of a conversational agent, there is the conversation\nitself. The conversation is implicitly passed to all the components throughout the flow. It contains\nthe messages being produced by the different nodes: each node in a flow and each agent can append\nmessages to the conversation if needed. Messages have, at least, a type (e.g., system, agent, user),\ncontent, the sender, and the recipient.\n2.2.8\nNode\nA Node is a vertex in a Flow and is derived from ComponentWithIO. Agent Spec provides a library\nof nodes designed to streamline workflow orchestration, enabling rapid development and seamless\nintegration for a wide range of applications:\n• LLMNode: uses a LLM to generate some text from a prompt.\n• APINode: performs an API call with the given configuration and inputs.\n• AgentNode: runs a multi-round conversation with an Agent component, used to better\nstructure agents and easily reuse Agent components.\n• FlowNode: runs a Flow, used to better structure agents and easily reuse Flows.\n• MapNode: performs a map-reduce operation on a given input collection, applying a specified\nFlow to each element in the collection.\n• StartNode: entry point of a Flow.\n• EndNode: exit point of a Flow.\n• BranchingNode: allows conditional branching based on the value of an input.\n• ToolNode: executes a tool.\nA more detailed description of each node type is given in https://oracle.github.io/agent-s\npec/agentspec/language_spec_25_4_1.html#standard-library-of-nodes-to-use-i\nn-flows.\n9\n2.3\nOpen Agent Specification Model\nThe objective of Agent Spec is to be agnostic with respect to any agentic framework and the\nprogramming language used to build and execute an agent. For this reason, an agent represented\nwith Agent Spec should be exportable to, and importable from a representation that is specified in a\ncommon serialization language. To this end, Agent Spec adopts JSON as the designated language for\nthe serialization of its components.\nAll building blocks of Agent Spec are designed with the goal of being trivially serializable. It follows\nthat the Agent Specification of a component can be obtained by serializing its definition according to\nthe JSON specification. In particular, the serialization of a component includes its attributes, plus an\nadditional field called component_type that will be used at deserialization time to infer the correct\ncomponent type to deserialize.\nNote that, as defined in the Agent Spec language, components can be declared only once in the\nrepresentation and then referenced according to the rules described in the Symbolic references section\nof this document.\nA few examples of component JSON serializations are given at https://oracle.github.io/age\nnt-spec/agentspec/language_spec_25_4_1.html#language-examples.\n2.4\nHow Agent Spec Works Across Frameworks\nAgent Spec serves as an abstraction layer above framework-specific implementations, acting as a\nunifying layer that encapsulates agent functionality beyond individual framework constraints.\nHence, the goal of Agent Spec is to define behavioral patterns for the different components that\nshould be implemented according to the specificities of the different agentic frameworks. An Agent\nSpec runtime for a specific framework should be able to read the Agent Specification of a component\n(e.g., a Flow or an Agent), and then execute its logic, adhering to the behavior described in the Agent\nSpec.\nAs an alternative, if the agentic framework - used to implement the runtime - offers a serialization\nmechanism, it is also possible to build a translation script between the specification of an agent and\nthe equivalent framework specific representation, then execute the runtime on the latter.\n2.5\nImplementation Details\n2.5.1\nAgent Spec SDKs\nTo facilitate the process of building programmatically framework-agnostic agents, Agent Spec SDK\npackages can be conveniently implemented. These SDKs should provide two functionalities:\n• Building Agent Spec component abstractions through the implementation of the relevant\ninterfaces, in conformity with the Agent Spec.\n• Import and export these abstractions from and to their respective serialized version in JSON\nformat.\nAs part of the Agent Spec effort, we provide Agent Spec’s Python SDK that we call PyAgentSpec.\nPyAgentSpec allows building Agent Spec-compliant agents in python. Users can create their own\nassistants using component classes that replicate the interface and behavior defined by Agent Spec,\nwhich can finally be exported in JSON format. Here is an example of how the definition of a simple\nagentic Flow prompting an LLM with a custom user input and returning the LLM’s output would\nlook like in PyAgentSpec.\n1 from pyagentspec.property import Property\n2 from pyagentspec.flows.flow import Flow\n3 from pyagentspec.flows.edges import ControlFlowEdge , DataFlowEdge\n4 from pyagentspec.flows.nodes import LlmNode , StartNode , EndNode\n5 from pyagentspec.llms import VllmConfig\n6 llm_config = VllmConfig(\n7\nname=\"<Your Model Name Here>\",\n8\nurl=\"<url.of.your.llm.deployment:port>\",\n10\n9\nmodel_id=\"<provider/model-identifier >\",\n10 )\n11 prompt_property = Property(\n12\njson_schema={\"title\": \"prompt\", \"type\": \"string\"}\n13 )\n14 llm_output_property = Property(\n15\njson_schema={\"title\": \"llm_output\", \"type\": \"string\"}\n16 )\n17 start_node = StartNode(name=\"start\", inputs=[prompt_property])\n18 end_node = EndNode(name=\"end\", outputs=[llm_output_property])\n19 llm_node = LlmNode(\n20\nname=\"simple llm node\",\n21\nllm_config=llm_config ,\n22\nprompt_template=\"{{prompt}}\",\n23\ninputs=[prompt_property],\n24\noutputs=[llm_output_property],\n25 )\n26 flow = Flow(\n27\nname=\"Simple prompting flow\",\n28\nstart_node=start_node ,\n29\nnodes=[start_node , llm_node , end_node],\n30\ncontrol_flow_connections=[\n31\nControlFlowEdge(name=\"start_to_llm\", from_node=start_node ,\nto_node=llm_node),\n32\nControlFlowEdge(name=\"llm_to_end\", from_node=llm_node , to_node=\nend_node),\n33\n],\n34\ndata_flow_connections=[\n35\nDataFlowEdge(\n36\nname=\"prompt_edge\",\n37\nsource_node=start_node ,\n38\nsource_output=\"prompt\",\n39\ndestination_node=llm_node ,\n40\ndestination_input=\"prompt\",\n41\n),\n42\nDataFlowEdge(\n43\nname=\"llm_output_edge\",\n44\nsource_node=llm_node ,\n45\nsource_output=\"llm_output\",\n46\ndestination_node=end_node ,\n47\ndestination_input=\"llm_output\"\n48\n),\n49\n],\n50 )\nTo export the Flow that was just built in JSON format, the code is the following.\n1 serializer = AgentSpecSerializer()\n2 serialized_flow = serializer.to_json(flow)\nThe full documentation of PyAgentSpec, including installation instructions, APIs documentation and\nexamples, is available at https://oracle.github.io/agent-spec/index.html.\n2.5.2\nAgent Spec SDK Plugins\nThe PyAgentSpec SDK also supports the concept of plugins, because we expect that teams using\nAgent Spec may want to create new component types to be included in their configurations. To\nthis end, a plugin can enable newer components in addition to the standard components of Agent\nSpec, simply by specifying the list of component types that the plugin includes and by providing the\nserialization and deserialization logic for the plugin. Such plugins can be implemented for components\nnot yet included in the first version of Agent Spec, such as multi-agent patterns, or planning and\nmemory components. See below the abstract interface to be implemented for a serialization plugin\n(the deserialization interface follows the same logic).\n11\n1 from abc import ABC, abstractmethod\n2 from typing import Any, Dict, List\n3\n4 from pyagentspec.component import Component\n5 from pyagentspec.serialization.serializationcontext import\nSerializationContext\n6\n7 class ComponentSerializationPlugin(ABC):\n8\n\"\"\"Base class for Component serialization plugins.\"\"\"\n9\n10\n@property\n11\n@abstractmethod\n12\ndef plugin_name(self) -> str:\n13\n\"\"\"Return the plugin name.\"\"\"\n14\npass\n15\n16\n@property\n17\n@abstractmethod\n18\ndef plugin_version(self) -> str:\n19\n\"\"\"Return the plugin version.\"\"\"\n20\npass\n21\n22\n@abstractmethod\n23\ndef supported_component_types(self) -> List[str]:\n24\n\"\"\"Indicate what component types the plugin supports.\"\"\"\n25\npass\n26\n27\n@abstractmethod\n28\ndef serialize(\n29\nself, component: Component , serialization_context:\nSerializationContext\n30\n) -> Dict[str, Any]:\n31\n\"\"\"Serialize a component that the plugin should support.\"\"\"\n32\npass\n2.5.3\nAgent Spec Runtime Adapters\nA runtime implementation makes Agent Spec components abstractions runnable by implementing\nthe behavioral logic described in the Agent Spec language.\nAs previously discussed, there are several ways to implement runtimes for Agent Spec. Ideally, a\nruntime implementation is an agentic framework that natively supports Agent Spec: it should read an\nAgent Spec JSON specification and transform it directly into an equivalent component that can be\nexecuted.\nAs an example of an Agent Spec runtime implementation, we provide a package called WayFlow,\nwhich is a powerful, intuitive Python library for building sophisticated AI-powered assistants. It\nincludes a library of plan steps to streamline the creation of AI-powered assistants, supports reusabil-\nity, and it is ideal for rapid development. The WayFlow framework provides a serialization and\ndeserialization interface to import and export Agent components according to the Agent Spec. It is a\nreference framework for Agent Spec and our runtime of reference, with native support for all Agent\nSpec Agents and Flows.\nWhen an agentic framework does not allow reading Agent Specifications directly, a translation\nlayer that transforms the Agent Specifications into a framework-specific representation could be\nadopted. This layer, which we can call Agent Spec Runtime adapter, loads an Agent Specification\nand transforms it into an equivalent component of the specific agentic framework.\nRuntime adapters enable existing agentic frameworks that do not support Agent Spec natively\nexecuting Agent Specifications. For example, we also provide runtime adapters for some of the\nmost popular agentic frameworks, including, but not limited to, LangGraph and Microsoft AutoGen.\nThese adapters load Agent Specifications taking advantage of the Agent Spec Python SDK, and they\ntransform the Agent Spec components into the respective versions defined in the agentic framework\nof interest.\n12\n2.6\nPerformance Evaluation & Benchmarks\nAgent Spec enables key aspects of productizing agent-driven solutions, including comparison and\nevaluation of agent task performance across different executing frameworks and models, as well as\noptimizations (including costs) of execution for underlying hardware and frameworks. By covering\ncommonly accepted concepts in agentic systems, such as workflows and agents, Agent Spec allows\ndevelopers to map these concepts to various execution frameworks, facilitating comparison of\nframework specific task performance. Compute optimization is also possible, as Agent Spec enables\nhardware-optimized and framework-optimized implementation of agentic design patterns.\n2.6.1\nPortability Analysis\nAgentic AI is rapidly evolving, and a unified benchmark for assessing agent reliability, particularly in\nenterprise settings, is currently lacking. Future updates for Agent Spec report will include empirical\nresults demonstrating the reliability of Agent Spec-defined agents across different frameworks.\nhttps://oracle.github.io/agent-spec/howtoguides/howto_execute_agentspec_ac\nross_frameworks.html provides an example of how an agent defined with Agent Spec can be run\nin different frameworks. In this Retrieval Augmented Generation case study, an agent utilizing the\nsame tools is instantiated in AutoGen, LangGraph, and WayFlow. In a practical setting, a specific\nmapping from Agent Spec to each framework would be implemented.\n2.6.2\nUse Cases & Real-World Applications\nA common use case of Agent Spec is the porting of agent-based assistants from one framework to\nanother. Let’s take as an example a team that implemented agent-based workflows using AutoGen. As\nbusiness and process needs to change, evaluations are conducted to consider alternative frameworks.\nDue to AutoGen’s specific architecture, migrating to another agentic framework proves to be complex\nwith significant rewriting overhead. In this example, Agent Spec enables the definition of business\nunit-specific agentic systems using a declarative representation. This allows for conversion to\nspecific framework formats or flexible execution across different agentic frameworks with appropriate\nadapters, enabling straightforward comparison of task performance and runtime cost depending\non the execution framework. Consequently, utilizing Agent Spec throughout the agent design and\ndeployment process reduces complexity, costs, implementation effort, and potential inconsistencies.\nAnother use case involves developing and deploying Agents across varied compute environments,\nsuch as cloud platforms and on-premise datacenters. In the cloud, Agents may run virtualized or\nserverless as part of a scalable system design. In an on-premise scenario, they may run within an\napplication server. Agent Spec’s framework and runtime agnosticism enables development of the\nAgent in a local development environment, followed by flexible deployment across either of these\nscenarios.\nA different compelling real-world application involves advanced multi-agent systems in the domain\nof financial crime compliance. By integrating generative AI agents, it enables to automate key\ninvestigative processes - supplementing human investigators with narrative-driven analyses, uncover-\ning critical insights, and recommending evidence-based actions. In this context, a comprehensive\nAnti-Money Laundering platform may comprise specialized agents tasked with sanctions screening,\ntransaction monitoring for suspicious activity, and the generation of enhanced due diligence reports.\nThese sub-agents are often developed by independent teams using a variety of frameworks and\ntechnologies, and may need to be deployed across heterogeneous environments, including cloud,\non-premises, or even within database systems. Leveraging Agent Spec’s framework-agnostic and\ndeclarative approach, development teams can seamlessly integrate and orchestrate these diverse agent\nworkflows, reducing integration overhead and enabling consistent, scalable deployment. This holistic\nand automated strategy minimizes manual effort, decreases operational risk, and empowers financial\ninstitutions to respond more rapidly and consistently to evolving financial crime patterns, regardless\nof the underlying deployment environment.\n2.7\nPositioning in the Ecosystem\nAgent Spec aims to streamline the architecture and design of agentic assistants and workflows,\nserving as a unified representation that abstracts away implementation details of specific agentic\n13\nframeworks. It is a portable configuration language that describes agentic design patterns, components\nand expected behavior. However, Agent Spec is not the only effort aimed at unifying the different\nparts that compose a common agentic ecosystem.\n• The Model Context Protocol (MCP) [7], introduced by Anthropic, standardizes resource and\ndata provision to agents. Resources are made available with a client/server based RESTful\nAPI.\n• Google’s Agent2Agent Protocol [2] and BeeAi’s Agent Communication Protocol (ACP) [3]\npropose standardized APIs for distributed agent communication.\n• Nvidia recently announced NeMo Agent toolkit which is a framework-independent library\nthat treats “every agent, tool, and agentic workflow as a function call—enabling composabil-\nity between these agents, tools, and workflows” [1]. The idea is to compose existing agentic\nsolutions and resources, potentially written using different frameworks, into new systems.\nWhile protocols like MCP and A2A standardize tool or resource provisioning as well as inter-agent\ncommunication, Agent Spec complements these efforts by enabling standardized configuration\nof components related to agentic system design and execution in general, as shown in Fig. 4.\nHence, Agent Spec provides strong synergies with other standardization efforts through its abstract\ndefinition of agentic system design. In the context of ongoing unification efforts within the agentic\nsystem landscape, Agent Spec aims to serve as the \"common foundation\" that connects these\ninitiatives, enhancing their effectiveness and fostering a more cohesive ecosystem. Support for the\naforementioned protocols may be added in future versions of Agent Spec as new components.\nFigure 4: Agent Spec complements other standardizations, such as MCP or A2A\n2.8\nFuture Roadmap & Enhancements\n2.8.1\nUpcoming Features\nExpanding the Open Agent Specification language We are looking forward to extending Agent\nSpec with new concepts and components in the upcoming versions of Agent Spec. A few notable\nones include:\n• Memory\n• Planning\n• Datastores\n• Support for remote agents (e.g., A2A agents)\n• Support for new types of tools (e.g., MCP tools)\n14\nExtending runtimes support\nWe want to foster the implementation of Agent Spec runtime adapters for the popular agentic\nframeworks in the vibrant AI community. At the same time, we aim to offer a conformance test suite\nfor runtimes to ensure consistent behavior in accordance with the Agent Specification.\nImproving user experience\nEven though Agent Spec SDKs simplify the creation and validation of Agent Specifications, creating\nagents by writing code might be complex and error-prone. We are working on a Drag&Drop UI that\nwill allow users to build their own agents in a visual interface and then export the Agent Specification\nto be used in the framework of their choice via a runtime adapter.\n2.8.2\nCommunity & Ecosystem Growth\nWe strongly believe Agent Spec will contribute to streamlining agent development and open-sourcing\nits specification to encourage community contributions. This will foster a rich ecosystem of inter-\nchangeable and reusable designs and tools for agentic AI development. Integration of Agent Spec\nby other third-party open-source projects as an agent design language and specification will benefit\nthe open-source community, which is currently evolving and lacks established common unified\nrepresentation. In summary, the key aspects of impact on community growth are:\n• Design patterns that can be easily shared & reused to collaboratively build increasingly\ncomplex solutions.\n• Enable open exchange of building blocks and agentic patterns.\n• Encourage contributions by the open-source community.\nTo help guide the evolution of the Agent Specification in alignment with its core design principles,\nwe will establish a steering committee. Similar to ONNX principles, this committee will work closely\nwith the community to review proposed contributions, foster open discussion, and publish versioned\nupdates.\n3\nContributors and Acknowledgements\nPlease cite this work as “Open Agent Specification (2025)”.\nYassine Benajiba, Cesare Bernardis, Vladislav Blinov, Paul Cayet, Hassan Chafi, Abderrahim Fathan,\nLouis Faucon, Damien Hilloulin, Sungpack Hong, Ingo Kossyk, Rhicheek Patra, Sujith Ravi, Jonas\nSchweizer, Jyotika Singh, Shailender Singh, Xuelin Situ, Weiyi Sun, Jerry Xu, Ying Xu.1\nWe are also thankful to our Oracle colleagues who engaged in active discussions during the design of\nAgent Spec and provided valuable feedback that helped us refine its specifications.\nReferences\n[1] NVidia.
