In increasingly\nauto-oriented cities, however, the growth of private vehicle use introduces both benefits and\nspatial tensions [2]. While cars can expand access and attract non-local customers, high\nvehicle density and on-street parking often compromise walkability and degrade the\npedestrian environments that local commerce depends on [3].\nThis tension is particularly evident in Chinese cities such as Harbin, where car ownership\nhas surged in recent decades [4]. Harbin’s urban structure is dominated by gated residential\ncommunities, a development pattern that concentrates commercial activity along perimeter\nstreets [5]. These boundary spaces, functioning as semi-public interfaces between enclosed\nliving areas and the broader city, vary significantly in their atmosphere and commercial\nperformance. Yet it remains unclear how the presence of motor vehicles — parked cars,\ncurbside traffic, and parking infrastructure—shapes such differences in street vitality.\nAlthough existing studies have explored how land use mix, density, and streetscape\ndesign influence commercial success [6], few have directly examined the micro-scale effects of\nvehicle presence on neighborhood commerce. Classic works such as Appleyard ’ s Livable\nStreets and Jacobs’s vision of sidewalk life emphasize the importance of walkable, socially\nvibrant streets [7][8]. However, in the context of semi-permeable Chinese communities, the\nrole of vehicles in shaping commercial outcomes remains largely unexplored [5].\nHarbin, a major city in Northeast China, provides a representative case for studying how\nmotor vehicle presence affects neighborhood commercial vitality. Its combination of historic\ndistricts and gated communities presents varied street forms and parking conditions, while\nits cold climate intensifies seasonal reliance on automobiles [9]. These features make Harbin\nbroadly reflective of Chinese cities facing growing motorization and evolving neighborhood\nstructures.\nThis study investigates how the presence of motor vehicles—particularly parked vehicle\ndensity and parking infrastructure—affects community-scale commercial activity in Harbin.\nUsing street-level imagery and multi-modal AI models, we extract measurable indicators of\nthe physical street environment. These are integrated with fine-grained commercial data from\nplatforms such as Meituan and Dazhong Dianping to assess the vitality of neighborhood\nbusinesses. Our analysis links macro-level attributes (e.g., location, accessibility) with\nmicro-level streetscape features (e.g., greenery, street width, cleanliness) to explain variation\nin commercial performance.\nWe address three research questions: (1) How are parked vehicle density and parking\navailability associated with community commercial activity? (2) How do other physical street\nattributes—such as greenery, width, and cleanliness—compare in their influence? (3) What\nintegrated framework can best explain variations in commercial vitality, accounting for both\nurban context and local street conditions?\nBy answering these questions, this paper contributes to the literature on urban\ncommercial dynamics by highlighting the role of motor vehicles at the community scale and\ndemonstrating the analytical value of AI-driven, image-based urban diagnostics. The\nremainder of the paper reviews relevant literature, outlines the research design, presents the\nresults, discusses the findings, and concludes with policy recommendations.\n2.Literature Review\n2.1.Reviewing the Evidence: Parking Infrastructure and Urban Retail Dynamics\nThe relationship between motor vehicles, parking, and commercial vitality has long been\ndebated in urban planning. A common belief among business owners is that easy car access\nand abundant parking are critical for retail success, and that pedestrianization or parking\nrestrictions may negatively impact business performance. However, empirical studies offer a\nmore nuanced understanding.\nRecent research from European city centers suggests that excessive on-street parking can\nactually detract from retail performance, while proximity to off-street parking, pedestrian\nzones, and transit stops is positively associated with commercial success [10]. For instance, a\n2023 study in Aachen, Germany found that a high density of curbside parking was correlated\nwith lower retail rents, whereas nearby parking garages and walkable conditions supported\nhigher commercial attractiveness [10]. These findings challenge the assumption that parking\nmust be directly adjacent to shops. Instead, they suggest that accessible but well-planned\nparking — within walking distance — can free up valuable streetfront space for sidewalks,\nseating, or greenery, thereby enhancing the pedestrian experience [11].\nIn other contexts, such as the UK, surveys reveal that retailers tend to overestimate the\nproportion of customers who drive and underestimate the spending of those who walk or use\ntransit [12]. These misperceptions further complicate assumptions about the role of cars in\nsustaining commercial vitality. Classic works like Appleyard’s Livable Streets demonstrated\nthat heavy traffic erodes social life on residential streets, reducing informal interaction and\nneighborhood cohesion [13]. This principle can be extended to commercial areas, where\nstreets dominated by vehicles may discourage lingering, reduce foot traffic, and weaken\ncustomer engagement [14].\nConversely, a complete absence of parking or vehicular access may limit the catchment\nof commercial streets—especially in suburban or low-density areas. Urban vitality research\ntherefore emphasizes balance: providing sufficient parking to maintain accessibility while\npreserving the walkability and social atmosphere of streets. The concept of “ park-once\nenvironments” reflects this ideal, where visitors can leave their cars in a centralized facility\nand walk comfortably to multiple destinations [15].\nIn community-scale commercial settings, such as those in Harbin, this balance may be\nespecially delicate. Local retail clusters often serve nearby residents but also attract some\ncar-based visitors, particularly in wealthier communities. When on-street parking is poorly\nmanaged—either scarce or overly dominant—it can deter both pedestrian and vehicle-based\nusers. This suggests a need for fine-grained studies that examine how different levels and\nconfigurations of vehicle presence influence commercial outcomes at the neighborhood scale\n[16-18].\n2.2. Perceptible Street Features and Commercial Vitality\nBeyond parking availability, a wide range of physical streetscape attributes influence\npedestrian behavior and, consequently, commercial vitality. Among these, street width and\ntraffic speed are particularly significant. Istrate found that on Shanghai residential streets,\nwider roadways showed a negative correlation with stationary pedestrian activity, despite\nnational planning standards that often encourage wide carriageways [19]. Narrower streets,\nespecially those where building facades closely align with sidewalks, promote walking and\nspontaneous interaction — benefiting cafes, small shops, and service-oriented retail. These\nobservations\necho\nlong-standing\nprinciples\nin\nhuman-scale\nurban\ndesign,\nwhere\ndisproportionally wide or fast-moving traffic corridors are associated\nwith reduced\nwalkability and diminished economic engagement [20, 21].\nStreetscape greening is another critical determinant of street appeal. Multiple studies\nconfirm that street trees and vegetation enhance not only aesthetic quality but also\ncommercial outcomes. Trees provide shading, visual softness, and a more comfortable\nmicroclimate, increasing the likelihood that pedestrians will linger and engage with\nstorefronts [22]. U.S.-based research has demonstrated that retail districts with high tree\ncanopy coverage see higher footfall, longer dwell times, and even 9 – 12% higher customer\nwillingness to pay for products [23]. Similar conclusions have been drawn in studies from\nMelbourne, Seoul, and Singapore, where tree-lined streets were rated more favorably in\nterms of perceived safety and ambience [24, 25]. In the context of Chinese cities, where street\ngreening varies markedly by district and development age, indicators such as Green View\nIndex (GVI) and visible planting are useful proxies for commercial street quality [26].\nCleanliness and physical maintenance also shape perceptions of safety, care, and\nprofessionalism—elements known to influence consumer behavior. Although rigorous causal\nstudies on this topic remain limited, retail business analysts have long noted the direct\nbenefits of clean sidewalks and storefronts, including improved visibility, stronger first\nimpressions, and higher repeat visitation rates [27, 28]. In urban governance contexts,\nparticularly within Chinese gated communities, the cleanliness of perimeter commercial\nstreets often depends on property management standards or local district efforts, making it a\nkey variable in explaining commercial performance variance across communities [29].\nLand use diversity and frontage activity further contribute to commercial liveliness.\nStreets lined with a dense mix of small shops, visible displays, and frequent entrances tend to\nencourage pedestrian movement and spontaneous browsing. Istrate reports that streets with\ngreater “permeability” and visible commercial variety support more stationary pedestrian\nbehaviors and social interaction, especially when integrated with residential access points [19].\nThis aligns with the “active edge ” theory of urban design, which posits that commercial\nsuccess often correlates with continuous, engaging façades at eye level [30, 31]. In Chinese\ngated communities, however, commercial uses are typically confined to perimeter bands,\nlimiting the natural integration of retail and residential space. Within this constraint, the\nspatial continuity, clustering intensity, and shopfront density of these bands may significantly\ninfluence customer flows.\n2.3. Street View Imagery and Multimodal AI in Urban Analysis\nTraditional studies of streetscape characteristics have long relied on field surveys,\nmanual audits, or researcher-led observations. In recent years, however, the proliferation of\nstreet view imagery platforms (e.g., Google Street View, Baidu Maps) has transformed urban\nanalysis, offering a scalable and standardized means to assess ground-level conditions across\nentire cities. According to a comprehensive review [32], street view imagery has rapidly\nbecome a critical geospatial data source in urban research, driven by advances in computer\nvision and machine learning.\nA growing body of literature has leveraged such imagery to quantify urban design\nfeatures — ranging from greenery and signage to façade articulation, sidewalk width, and\neven perceived safety or vibrancy [33 – 35]. This shift allows researchers to systematically\nextract micro-scale spatial features that are otherwise hard to detect through satellite images\nor conventional GIS datasets.\nOne major application involves computer vision–based object detection, where models\nsuch as YOLO, Faster R-CNN, or Mask R-CNN are trained to identify and count specific\nstreet elements. These models can, for example, detect vehicles, parking signage, crosswalks,\nor trees, enabling researchers to compute metrics like “vehicles per image” or “greenery\nratio ”\n[36, 37]. A commonly used metric, the Green View Index (GVI), calculates the\nproportion of green pixels in an image after semantic segmentation, serving as a proxy for\nstreet-level greenness [38].\nMore recently, the field has moved beyond feature detection to explore subjective\nperception modeling. Deep neural networks, especially convolutional neural networks\n(CNNs), have been trained on labeled street view datasets — often with human ratings on\nsafety, comfort, or vibrancy — to predict perceptual qualities from new images [39]. This\nallows computational models to approximate how humans experience urban spaces, not just\nwhat physical elements exist. For example, one study combined image-derived features with\npoint-of-interest (POI) density to predict urban vitality hotspots, showing that the inclusion\nof visual features significantly enhanced prediction accuracy [40].\nA frontier development in this domain is the use of multimodal large language models\n(MLLMs), such as CogVLM or GPT-4V, which can process both image and text inputs. These\nmodels, pre-trained on vast image – text pairs, are capable of answering natural language\nqueries about visual content (e.g., “How many cars are parked here?” or “Does this street\nappear clean?”) [41, 42]. This enables more flexible and nuanced interpretation of streetscapes\n—capturing both quantitative (e.g., vehicle counts) and qualitative (e.g., perceived tidiness)\naspects, which conventional computer vision may struggle to encode directly.\nFor example, one study analyzed spontaneous commercial setups in historic Chinese\nneighborhoods using over 10,000 street view images and AI-based workflows [43]. Their\nmethodology integrated Mask R-CNN for object detection, random forest models for\nregression, and SHAP values for explainability, revealing strong links between informal\nvendor density and pedestrian activity. Their results support the potential of image-based\nmetrics as robust proxies for commercial liveliness.\nInspired by such advances, our study combines image-derived features—such as parked\nvehicle density and visual greenery—with business activity indicators from digital commerce\nplatforms. We also incorporate a multimodal foundation model (VisualGLM-6B), fine-tuned\nfor street scene interpretation, making this one of the first applications of such models in a\nChinese community-scale urban context. The inclusion of MLLMs enables us to extract both\nvisual counts and qualitative descriptors (like perceived cleanliness), potentially offering a\nricher feature set for commercial vitality modeling.\nIn summary, three strands of literature inform our work:\n(1) the complex and context-dependent relationship between vehicles/parking and\ncommercial outcomes;\n(2) the influence of diverse streetscape attributes on pedestrian and retail dynamics; and\n(3) the emergence of AI-enabled methods for large-scale urban feature extraction using\nstreet imagery.\nOur empirical study synthesizes these threads by applying state-of-the-art visual AI to\nstreet-level data from Harbin, examining how the micro-scale spatial environment correlates\nwith the economic activity of community commercial areas.\n3. Methodology\n3.1. Study Area and Units of Analysis\nThis study examines Harbin, a major city in northeastern China with a metropolitan\npopulation exceeding five million. The city’s residential fabric is largely composed of gated\ncommunities, each encompassing multiple apartment buildings enclosed within a defined\nperimeter. While internal areas of these communities typically lack commercial functions,\nsmall-scale retail and service activities are commonly distributed along the perimeter streets,\nforming linear commercial belts that cater primarily to local residents.\nOur analysis focuses on these boundary-level commercial zones, which represent a key\ninterface between the enclosed residential core and the public realm. Given the absence of\ncommercial\nfrontages\nin\nmost\ncommunity\ninteriors,\nthe\nstudy\nexclusively\ntargets\ncommunities situated in peripheral districts where street-facing businesses are present and\nobservable via panoramic imagery.\nA sample of residential communities was selected to capture variation in spatial\nmorphology, socio-economic status, and observed levels of commercial activity. Each\ncommunity serves as the primary unit of analysis. For each unit, we derived commercial\nvitality\nindicators,\nquantified\nstreetscape\nattributes\nsuch\nas\nvehicle\npresence\nand\nenvironmental conditions, and incorporated contextual urban variables extracted from both\nvisual and geographic data. While the community is the core analytic scale, individual street\nsegments along the community perimeter were also examined to support micro-spatial\nanalysis where applicable.\n3.2. Data Collection\n3.2.1 Street View Imagery Acquisition\nTo extract physical characteristics of community commercial streetscapes, we utilized\npanoramic imagery from Baidu Street View, which provides high-resolution coverage for\nmost urban streets in Harbin. As Google Street View is unavailable in China, Baidu served as\nthe primary and consistent source.\nGiven our focus on summer conditions—when vegetation, pedestrian activity, and street\ncleanliness are most visible — we excluded any winter or snow-covered images from the\ndataset. Only summer imagery (2021–2023) was used to ensure comparability across scenes.\nThe sampling covered all accessible residential communities within Harbin’s urban core.\nFor each community, we first identified key street segments that plausibly serve commercial\nfunctions based on their proximity to community gates. A spatial distance-based filtering\nmethod was applied to determine whether a street segment lay within a reasonable perimeter\nof the residential compound. In cases involving irregularly shaped communities or\nambiguous edge conditions, street segments were manually reviewed and sampling points\nadjusted accordingly.\nFor\neach\nqualified\nstreet\nsegment,\nstreet\nview\npanoramas\nwere\nretrieved\nat\napproximately 50–100 meter intervals. Each community was represented by 10–15 images on\naverage, covering both sides of the street when available. All panoramas were transformed\ninto planar perspective views suitable for automated visual analysis.\n3.2.2 Commercial Vitality Data\nTo quantitatively assess community-level commercial vitality, we collected data from\nMeituan and Dazhong Dianping, China’s leading digital platforms for local business listings\nand consumer reviews—functionally analogous to Yelp or Google Maps in Western contexts.\nThese platforms provide real-time, user-generated information on a wide range of businesses,\nmaking them a valuable proxy for consumer activity and commercial density.\nFor each sampled community, we extracted data on businesses located along the\nidentified commercial street segments. In some cases, a spatial buffer was applied to ensure\ninclusion of relevant establishments geocoded within the community’s immediate vicinity.\nThe following variables were retrieved:\n\nTotal number of businesses, disaggregated by type (e.g., restaurants, grocery stores, cafes,\nbeauty salons);\n\nConsumer review counts and average ratings, which serve as behavioral indicators of\nfoot traffic and popularity;\n\nSales volume data, such as monthly order counts displayed for some restaurants on\nMeituan;\n\nPresence of key anchor amenities, including convenience store chains, supermarkets, or\nfarmers’ markets known to generate sustained footfall.\nBased on these variables, we constructed a Community Commercial Vitality Index (CCVI)\nto represent the overall scale and activity level of the commercial area. While statistical\nmethods such as principal component analysis (PCA) could be employed to weight the\ncomponents, we opted for a transparent weighted sum approach for interpretability. The\nindex is calculated as:\nCCVI = �1·(totalbusiness) + �2·(avg. rating × avg. reviews)\n+ �3·(anchorpersence) + . . .\n(1)\nWeights ��were determined based on empirical judgment and iteratively adjusted to\nalign with qualitative assessments (e.g., communities known locally for vibrant commerce\nconsistently achieved higher CCVI scores). The index was normalized to a 0– 100 scale for\ncomparability across communities.\nIt should be noted that Meituan and Dianping data are temporally dynamic. All data\nwere collected in August 2023, providing a consistent snapshot across the study area. Since\nconsumer review counts reflect cumulative interaction and not only recent activity, the CCVI\nrepresents a blended indicator of both historical popularity and present operational status.\nCommunities with numerous closed storefronts or low business density typically exhibited\nlow review counts and few amenities, yielding lower CCVI values—interpreted as indicative\nof weak commercial vitality.\n3.2.3 Street Feature Extraction via Multimodal Analysis\nTo extract relevant street-level features from the collected panoramas, we employed a\nmultimodal analysis pipeline based on GPT-4’s vision-language capabilities, incorporating a\nsmall-sample learning strategy. Rather than relying on traditional computer vision models\nthat require large annotated datasets and domain-specific tuning, we fine-tuned GPT-4\nprompts using a compact but carefully labeled training set of approximately 300 street view\nimages. These images were drawn from diverse communities in our sample to capture\nvariation in environmental quality, spatial configuration, and commercial intensity.\nEach training image was manually annotated by human coders with structured labels:\napproximate vehicle count, presence of marked parking spaces, estimated street width\ncategory, greenery level (e.g., “no greenery,” “some trees,” “tree-lined”), and a cleanliness\nscore on a 1–5 scale. Additional qualitative descriptors were added to align image content\nwith natural language prompts. Based on this, we developed a prompting template that\nguided GPT-4 to consistently output descriptive sentences from which structured variables\ncould be parsed.\nFigure 1. Architecture of Multimodal Model for Perception and Spatial Analysis\nFor the main analysis, we applied this prompt structure to the full image set. GPT-4 was\nqueried with standardized instructions—for example, “Describe the street’s vehicle presence,\nparking condition, greenery, width, and overall cleanliness.” The responses, such as “There\nare about four vehicles visible, mostly parallel parked. The street appears clean with scattered\nlitter, and has a few trees along the side,” were then translated into quantitative variables\nthrough rule-based parsing. For instance, “about four vehicles” was recorded as 4, “a few\ntrees” mapped to a greenery level of 2 on a 0–3 scale, and “clean with scattered litter” to a\ncleanliness score of 4 out of 5.\nStreet width was approximated from the model ’ s textual estimation (e.g., “ narrow, ”\n“ moderately wide ” ) and cross-validated using visual cues from the image ’ s geometry.\nParking presence was treated as a binary indicator (marked/unmarked), and vehicle density\nwas averaged across images for each community. To reduce temporal noise, all images used\nwere captured in the summer months and excluded winter scenes, ensuring visual\ncomparability across the dataset. On average, each community had 10–15 usable images, with\nspatial coverage manually verified based on perimeter road distances and segment geometry.\nThis small-sample learning approach enabled us to leverage GPT-4 ’ s generalization\ncapacity without requiring extensive manual annotation. Preliminary comparisons with\nhuman-coded test images indicated high consistency for count-based attributes (typically\nwithin ±1 vehicle) and stable ordinal classification for perceptual features like cleanliness and\ngreenery. The resulting dataset provides a set of image-derived, human-aligned indicators\nthat capture both physical and perceptual qualities of commercial streetscapes.\n3.3. Analytical Methods\nOur analysis proceeded at two levels: descriptive exploration and inferential modeling,\naiming to understand the relationship between community street features and commercial\nvitality.\nAt the descriptive level, we began by examining the distribution of key variables across\ncommunities. These included the Community Commercial Vitality Index (CCVI), parked\nvehicle counts, Green View Index (GVI), and cleanliness scores. We visualized these\nindicators through bar charts (CCVI sorted across all communities), scatter plots (average\nvehicle presence versus shop count), and histograms (GVI and cleanliness) to understand\ntheir overall spread and variance. To complement these quantitative descriptions, we\nqualitatively compared selected pairs of communities — contrasting high- and low-vitality\nexamples with street view illustrations — to highlight spatial and perceptual differences\nobservable in the built environment.\nTo quantify relationships, we calculated Pearson correlation coefficients between each\nstreet-level feature and the CCVI. These initial correlations offered insight into linear\nassociations but could not control for confounding effects or multicollinearity. We thus\nproceeded with multivariate linear regression analysis. The baseline model regressed the\nCCVI on key independent variables, including average vehicle counts, presence of parking\ninfrastructure, GVI, street width, and cleanliness scores. To account for broader locational\ninfluences, we included two control variables: population density and distance to the central\nbusiness district (CBD). This allowed us to examine the marginal effects of street-level\ncharacteristics net of macro spatial factors. The full model took the form:\nCCVI�= �0 + �1 (Vehicles�) + �2 (Parking�) + �3 (GVI�) + �4 (Width�)\n+ �5 (Cleanliness�) + �6 (PopDensity�) + �7 (DistanceCBD�) + ��\n(2)\nBeyond main effects, we tested interaction terms to probe conditional relationships. For\nexample, the interaction between vehicle presence and street width examined whether high\nvehicle density had more detrimental effects on narrower streets, as hypothesized. Similarly,\nwe explored whether high levels of greenery or cleanliness moderated the influence of\nvehicular presence — testing the idea that aesthetic qualities might buffer the commercial\nimpact of cars.\nGiven our modest sample size (likely under 100 communities), we applied model\nselection techniques cautiously to avoid overfitting. We reported adjusted R² and p-values\nfor all coefficients, and when applicable, used stepwise selection and AIC comparison to\nevaluate model parsimony.\nTo assess variable importance and comparative influence, we examined standardized\nregression coefficients and additionally employed machine learning-based robustness checks.\nA random forest regressor was trained on the same dataset to obtain relative feature\nimportances, while dominance analysis or Shapley value decomposition provided alternative\ninsights into each factor ’ s contribution. These results were summarized in graphical form\n(e.g., a ranked bar chart of predictors’ influence on vitality outcomes).\nValidation occurred along two axes. Internally, we conducted cross-validation by\npartitioning the dataset and verifying model stability. Externally, we cross-referenced\nmodel-predicted vitality with qualitative local knowledge, such as media reports or known\nhotspots of street activity in Harbin. Where available, third-party data sources (Dianping user\ncheck-ins) were considered to triangulate findings.\nAll statistical computations were performed using standard tools in Python (pandas,\nstatsmodels, scikit-learn), and results are reported with conventional significance thresholds\n(p < 0.05, p < 0.01).\nTaken together, these analytical strategies aim to reveal which features of the street\nenvironment\nmost\nconsistently\nrelate\nto\ncommunity\ncommercial\nvitality,\nwhile\nacknowledging that correlation does not imply causation. Rather, the patterns observed\nprovide grounded hypotheses for urban design and planning practice, which we elaborate in\nthe discussion section.\n4. Data Analysis and Results\n4.1. Descriptive Overview\nThe sampled communities in Harbin exhibited substantial variation in commercial\nvitality. The Community Commercial Vitality Index (CCVI), scaled from 0 to 100, ranged\nfrom approximately 20 in the least active neighborhoods to over 85 in the most vibrant ones.\nHigh-CCVI communities were typically situated near major transit nodes or university\ncampuses, with over 50 operating shops and restaurants — many of which accumulated\nhundreds of consumer reviews. In contrast, low-CCVI areas were often peripheral housing\nenclaves with minimal retail infrastructure, typically limited to convenience stores or\npharmacies.\nA spatial distribution map of CCVI values (Figure 2) revealed that high-vitality clusters\ntended to be located in central districts, aligning with well-established expectations of\nlocational advantage. Nevertheless, there were noteworthy exceptions: several suburban\ncommunities displayed unexpectedly strong commercial activity, often due to proximity to\nspecialized amenities such as food streets, parks, or regional transit stops. Conversely, some\ncentrally located neighborhoods performed poorly, possibly due to restricted access,\ncompetition saturation, or physical disconnection. These spatial outliers suggest that local\nstreet-level features may play a decisive role beyond macro-location factors.\n(a)\n(b)\nFigure 2. Spatial distribution of street-level indicators: (a) CCVI heat map highlighting\ncommercial-vitality hot spots; (b) corresponding curb-side vehicle-density map, showing zones of\nintense on-street parking\nThe presence of street-side vehicles also varied considerably across communities (Figure\n3). While some streets appeared nearly empty — either reflecting low demand or explicit\nparking restrictions — others were heavily congested with cars parked on both sides. On\naverage,\n3.2\nvehicles\nwere\nobserved\nper\nstreet-view\nframe,\nwhich\ntypically\nspans\napproximately 30 meters of street frontage. This translates to about 10–12 parked vehicles per\n100 meters in higher-activity areas. Notably, greater vehicle presence did not consistently\ncorrespond with higher commercial vitality: one mid-range CCVI community recorded the\nhighest curbside parking intensity, suggesting that excessive on-street parking may introduce\nfunctional or aesthetic disamenities that detract from street vibrancy.\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\n(d)\nFigure 3. Distributions of curb-side parking, perceptual greenery, street width, and\ncleanliness across:(a) Curb‑Side Parking Intensity; (b) Perceptual Greenery Categories; (c)\nStreet‑Width Distribution; (d)Cleanliness Ratings\nStreet greenery, as expressed through the Green View Index (GVI), also demonstrated\nwide variation. However, it is important to clarify that our study did not rely on pixel-based\nsegmentation for precise GVI computation. Instead, we employed GPT-4 ’ s multimodal\ncapabilities to approximate greenery levels based on annotated training data, yielding\nqualitative categories (e.g., “few trees,” “tree-lined street”) that were subsequently mapped\nto ordinal scores. While not a precise measure of vegetative cover, this perceptual proxy\ncaptures how greenery is likely experienced by pedestrians. Across the sample, estimated\nGVI ranged from approximately 5% in barren streets to over 30% in well-vegetated corridors.\nThe average was about 15%, consistent with Harbin’s legacy of hardscaped Soviet-era urban\ndesign, though newer developments displayed more greenery.\nStreet width also showed structural diversity. The average curb-to-curb width was\napproximately 14 meters, with around 40% of streets categorized as narrow (<10m), 50% as\nmedium (10 – 20m), and just 10% as wide (>20m). Wider streets were almost exclusively\nlocated in newly developed zones. Cleanliness, scored through a combination of VisualGLM\noutputs and human annotation, was generally high: most communities received a rating of 4\nout of 5 or a qualitative label of “clean.” A minority of older commercial alleys scored lower\n(e.g., 2 or “dirty”), often due to visible litter or deteriorated pavement.\nAlthough not a core focus, pedestrian visibility was also recorded when identifiable in\nthe images. High-vitality communities typically exhibited greater pedestrian presence,\nwhereas low-vitality areas showed sparsely populated or empty sidewalks. However, image\ncapture timing (e.g., early morning or off-peak hours) introduces uncertainty into these\nobservations, and thus, such patterns are interpreted with caution.\nTable 1 summarizes the key descriptive statistics. A preliminary contrast between the\nfive highest- and lowest-CCVI communities suggests a recurring pattern: commercially\nvibrant communities tend to combine moderate vehicle presence, higher perceived greenery,\nand better cleanliness. In contrast, underperforming areas often suffer from environmental\ndegradation and street-use imbalance—either due to a lack of vehicular or pedestrian activity\n(suggesting isolation), or excessive congestion (suggesting spatial dysfunction). These\nfindings underscore the complex and interactive roles of physical infrastructure and\nperceived street quality in shaping community-level commercial outcomes.\nTable 1.

Correlation Analysis\nTo explore the relationships between streetscape features and both perceived satisfaction\nand commercial pricing, we conducted a series of bivariate correlation analyses (Figure 4).\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\n(d)\nFigure 4. Streetscape attributes, satisfaction, and commercial pricing: (a) Correlation with\nsatisfaction; (b) Correlation with average store price; (c) Parked vehicles vs. satisfaction, stratified\nby street-width category (narrow vs wide); (d)Parked vehicles vs. average store price, stratified by\nstreet-width category\nOur results indicate that greenery (Green View Index), cleanliness, and sidewalk width\nexhibit clear positive correlations with street satisfaction scores. Among these, greenery and\ncleanliness are the strongest predictors, followed by sidewalk width. The influence of\ncarriageway width is relatively weaker, but still positive. These findings are consistent with\nprior literature emphasizing the importance of pedestrian-friendly environments and daily\nspatial comfort in shaping user satisfaction.\nWhen examining associations with average store pricing — used as a proxy for\ncommercial positioning—we observe a different pattern. While greenery and cleanliness are\nstill positively related, their correlations are notably weaker than with satisfaction. Instead,\nsidewalk and carriageway width demonstrate stronger positive associations with average\nprices, suggesting that wider, better-structured streets may support more upscale commercial\nenvironments. This echoes arguments from biophilic urbanism and walkability research,\nwhich posit that enhanced spatial environments can elevate perceived commercial value.\nOne particularly nuanced result involves the number of parked vehicles, which shows no\nconsistent linear correlation with either satisfaction or price across the sample. However,\nwhen conditional on street width, the relationship becomes more interpretable. In narrow\nstreets, higher vehicle counts are associated with both lower satisfaction and lower store\npricing—likely reflecting congestion and diminished walkability. In contrast, on wider streets,\nvehicle density has less impact on satisfaction and may even correspond to slightly higher\nstore prices, potentially reflecting stronger demand in commercially active corridors.\nThese conditional patterns suggest that the effect of parking and traffic features on\nperception and economic outcome is moderated by the physical structure of the street itself.\nThis aligns with our field observations: communities with constrained street profiles and\nheavy on-street parking often exhibit degraded walkability, while those with broader\ncorridors can accommodate both vehicular and pedestrian flows more harmoniously.\nTogether, these findings point toward a multifaceted interaction between environmental\nquality, street design, and commercial outcomes — underscoring the importance of\nconsidering both physical structure and sensory attributes when evaluating community\nvitality.\n4.3. Regression Results\nBuilding on the correlation patterns, we estimated multiple regression models to uncover\nhow different streetscape features influence perceived satisfaction and commercial pricing.\nWhile greenery, cleanliness, and pedestrian space had robust effects on satisfaction, the\nrelationships with average shop price proved more nuanced, particularly in regard to vehicle\npresence and street width.\nIn our baseline model, both sidewalk width and carriageway width displayed significant\nand positive associations with store pricing. This suggests that communities with broader,\nbetter-structured streets tend to host higher-priced commercial establishments. By contrast,\ngreenery and cleanliness—though strongly linked with satisfaction—exhibited much weaker\nand statistically insignificant coefficients when predicting average shop price. These results\nsuggest that while environmental quality enhances the user experience, it is physical\naccessibility that exerts more direct influence on commercial value.\nThe role of vehicle presence appeared complex. In linear models, the average number of\nparked vehicles was not significantly associated with pricing. However, when we introduced\ninteraction terms with street width, a conditional relationship became evident. As shown in\nFigure 5, the pricing response to increasing parking availability diverged sharply based on\nstreet geometry.\nFigure 5. Shop-price response to on-street parking by street width\nOn narrow streets, additional on-street parking consistently correlated with lower\naverage store prices. This likely reflects the detrimental effects of congestion, limited\npedestrian space, and diminished overall walkability. In these environments, more parking\nappears to crowd the spatial experience, potentially undermining both foot traffic and\nperceived quality.\nIn contrast, wide streets exhibited a distinctly different pattern. Shop prices initially rose\nwith the number of parking spaces, peaking around the 50–60 space range. This suggests that,\nwhen sufficient roadway capacity exists, additional parking may reflect or enable greater\nconsumer throughput. However, the benefit was not indefinite: beyond a certain point,\nfurther increases in parking corresponded to a decline in average pricing — indicating\ndiminishing returns and possible oversaturation.\nThis non-linear relationship underscores the idea of a contextual threshold: in spatially\ngenerous environments, parking can be an asset — up to a limit. But in compact or\nhuman-scale settings, parking beyond a minimal level may function as a disamenity.\nIn sum, our regression results reveal that the commercial effect of parking is not\nuniversal, but contingent on street form. This suggests that policy efforts to support local\ncommerce must consider how infrastructural interventions interact with the morphology of\nspace: the same intervention (e.g., adding parking) may foster commercial value in one\nsetting while undermining it in another.\n4.4. Summary of Results\nOur\nfindings\nreveal\na\nnuanced\ninterplay\nbetween\nstreet\ndesign,\nenvironmental\nperception, and commercial outcomes in community-scale retail spaces. While vehicle\npresence does correlate with commercial vitality to some degree, the relationship is far from\nlinear. Communities with moderate levels of parking tend to show higher retail activity, yet\nthis effect diminishes or even reverses when the number of parked vehicles exceeds a certain\nthreshold—particularly on narrower streets where curb congestion undermines pedestrian\ncomfort. Conversely, in wider streets with sufficient spatial capacity, additional parking can\nsometimes align with higher average shop prices, suggesting that well-structured vehicular\naccess can support more economically robust retail activity. However, even in these cases, the\nbenefit plateaus and declines if the space becomes overly vehicle-dominated.\nStreet greenery and cleanliness emerged as the strongest predictors of perceived\nsatisfaction with the street environment. Communities with higher Green View Index scores\nand cleaner frontages consistently performed better in terms of satisfaction metrics,\nreinforcing the notion that aesthetic and hygienic qualities of streetscapes play a vital role in\nhow residents experience and evaluate their surroundings. These features, however, showed\nweaker correlations with average shop price, indicating that while they enhance everyday\nlivability, they do not directly translate into higher commercial pricing. In contrast, the\nwidths of sidewalks and carriageways were more closely tied to commercial pricing,\nsuggesting that physical accessibility and openness are key determinants of retail value.\nThe interaction between parked vehicle count and street width further illuminates this\npoint. In communities with narrow streets, an increase in vehicle presence was generally\nassociated with lower satisfaction and commercial pricing, likely due to reduced walkability\nand spatial discomfort. On wider streets, however, vehicle presence showed a more complex\npattern: while satisfaction still tended to decline slightly with higher vehicle density, store\nprices increased up to a point, hinting at a trade-off between spatial pressure and commercial\ndemand. This reflects a broader tension between vehicular accessibility and pedestrian\nquality—one that must be carefully balanced in neighborhood commercial planning.\nOverall, our models suggest that micro-scale urban design features — greenery, street\nwidth, cleanliness, and managed parking — exert significant influence on both subjective\nsatisfaction and objective commercial indicators. Importantly, these micro features explain a\nsubstantial portion of the variation in community commercial outcomes, even after\ncontrolling for macro-level factors such as distance to the city center and population density.\nThis implies that thoughtful design interventions at the street level have the potential to\nelevate neighborhood commerce and improve everyday life, even in locations that may not\nenjoy prime geographic advantage. It is not the presence or absence of cars alone, but the\nquality and spatial integration of all elements — vehicles, trees, pavement, people — that\nultimately shapes a street’s commercial and social success.\n5. Discussion\nThis study offers a refined perspective on how motor vehicle activity interacts with\nmicro-scale urban design to shape community-level commercial vitality. In this section, we\ninterpret our findings in relation to theoretical expectations and practical urban dynamics,\ndiscuss limitations including data temporality, and propose a conceptual framework\nintegrating macro and micro factors. We also assess how these insights might inform urban\npolicy and be extended to other urban contexts.\n5.1 How Vehicle Activity Shapes Commercial Opportunities\nThe evidence from Harbin points to a “Goldilocks zone” in vehicle presence—too little\nand too much both undermine commercial vitality. A moderate level of vehicular activity,\nindicated by parked cars and passing traffic, may signal accessibility and customer potential.\nThis is particularly relevant in gated communities where local foot traffic alone may not\nsustain a diverse commercial base. Allowing some vehicle inflow can extend the community’\ns retail reach, aligning with economic geography theories that emphasize market accessibility.\nHowever, as vehicle presence intensifies — manifested through saturated curbs,\ncongestion, and even illegal parking — its marginal contribution reverses. Excessive cars\ndiminish walkability, visual comfort, and safety, making the street less appealing to\npedestrians. Our results suggest that beyond a certain threshold, additional vehicles are\nassociated with declining commercial outcomes, reinforcing similar findings from city-centre\nretail studies such as in Aachen. In gated community settings, this may be compounded by\nspatial constraints that heighten the negative impacts of vehicle crowding.\nA key moderating factor is parking management. Communities offering off-street lots\nnear retail zones exhibited consistently better outcomes. This indicates that separating vehicle\nstorage\nfrom\nthe\nimmediate\npedestrian\nspace\ncan\npreserve\nwalkability\nwhile\nstill\naccommodating accessibility. The logic mirrors downtown planning approaches — like\npark-once strategies — but at a micro-neighborhood scale. Our findings highlight the\noften-overlooked importance of parking configuration within small community centers, not\njust large urban cores.\nImportantly, we do not suggest a causal chain where more cars cause vitality. Rather, the\npresence of cars may be as much an outcome as a driver of commercial success. Still, a\ncomplete lack of vehicle access imposes hard limits on potential patronage, particularly in\ncities like Harbin where public transit, while present, is not always fine-grained. Our\nconclusion is that the optimal strategy is one of balance: allow cars, but design around people.\n5.2 The Impact of Street Environment: Greenery, Width, and Cleanliness\nEnvironmental quality — particularly greenery — emerged as a dominant factor\ninfluencing perceived satisfaction. Streets with mature trees and visible landscaping were\nconsistently associated with higher user ratings, reinforcing design principles that emphasize\nthe psychological and experiential benefits of nature in urban space. In hot-summer cities like\nHarbin, tree cover may also offer tangible comfort advantages such as shade and reduced\nheat, encouraging foot traffic and lingering.\nStreet width, too, had a clear effect. Narrower streets—often associated with older, more\ntraditional layouts — outperformed wider roads in commercial vitality. This may reflect\nimproved pedestrian safety, visual enclosure, and the ease with which people can engage\nwith storefronts on both sides of the street. Wider streets, while supporting vehicle flow,\noften hinder the spatial coherence of commercial corridors, separating businesses from\npedestrians\nand\nintroducing\nbarriers\nto\ninteraction.\nThis\nfinding\naligns\nwith\nboth\ncontemporary Chinese planning critiques and long-standing urban theory from figures such\nas Jane Jacobs and Jan Gehl.\nCleanliness, though less statistically dominant, nonetheless played a meaningful role.\nUnclean or neglected streets tended to score lower on both satisfaction and perceived\nvibrancy, while clean streets likely reinforced a sense of order, security, and community pride.\nThe mechanism may be both perceptual and behavioral: shoppers prefer clean environments,\nand successful commercial areas may be better maintained as a result. The feedback loop—\nwhere vibrant areas support better upkeep and vice versa—is consistent with literature on\npublic space management, even if hard empirical data on this remains limited.\n5.3 Macro vs. Micro Factors: An Integrated Framework\nOur study supports an integrated view of commercial vitality that spans both structural\nand design-level determinants. At the macro scale, factors like distance to the city center,\ntransit connectivity, population density, and socioeconomic profile define a community ’ s\nlatent potential for retail activity. However, our regression results indicate that these macro\nconditions alone do not fully explain variations in performance.\nAt the micro scale, streetscape attributes — greenery, street width, cleanliness, and\nparking provision — play a critical role in activating or suppressing this potential.\nWell-designed streets can overcome certain locational disadvantages, while poorly designed\nstreets may squander strong geographic advantages. In this view, macro factors provide the\n\"fuel\" for vitality, while micro design acts as the \"engine\" that translates potential into\noutcomes. Communities that align both dimensions — centrally located with attractive,\nwalkable, and well-managed streets—consistently performed best in our sample.\nThis framework suggests a dual strategy for urban policy: invest in both broader\nconnectivity and local design. Crucially, micro-scale interventions are often more actionable\nand quicker to implement than macro-scale changes. Tree planting, sidewalk redesign, and\nparking restructuring can be achieved within years, whereas transit expansion and land-use\nshifts may take decades.\n5.4 Image-Based Data and Analytical Limitations\nWhile street view imagery offers a scalable, low-cost way to observe urban environments,\nit also introduces methodological constraints. Images are time-bound snapshots, and\nconditions at the moment of capture—hour of day, season, or special events—may not reflect\ntypical activity. For instance, early morning images may show few pedestrians and low car\npresence even in normally vibrant areas. Similarly, winter images may underrepresent\ngreenery or overstate cleanliness issues due to snow or slush.\nWe attempted to account for this by logging seasons and cross-checking vegetation\npresence with municipal tree inventories when available. Nevertheless, this temporal\nvariability introduces noise that may dilute some observed relationships. Moreover, our\noperationalization of vehicle presence and pedestrian density relies on visible cues, which\nmay not always correspond to actual usage patterns. Parked cars may belong to residents\nrather than shoppers, and customer activity may not align with platform reviews or foot\ntraffic captured in a single image.\nAdditionally, our integration of Meituan and Dianping data, while useful, approximates\nvitality through cumulative review volume and popularity metrics. These proxies can lag\nreal-time business performance or be skewed by platform dynamics. Future work should\nincorporate finer-grained behavioral data — such as mobile location traces, shop-level\ntransaction records, or pedestrian counters—alongside traditional observational methods.\nDespite these limitations, the consistency of our results across multiple methods\n(correlation, regression, case comparison) supports the robustness of the findings. Still, we\nadvocate for cautious interpretation, especially when generalizing coefficients across\ncontexts.\n5.5 Generalizability and Broader Implications\nThough focused on Harbin, our findings likely extend to many mid- and large-scale\nChinese cities with similar gated community layouts and rising car ownership. The tension\nbetween vehicular access and pedestrian comfort is a common theme across urban China. The\npositive role of greenery and human-scaled design in supporting retail activity is almost\nuniversally applicable, as is the utility of scalable AI-assisted assessment methods using street\nview imagery.\nCaution is warranted, however, in applying these results to cities with radically different\ntransport cultures. In places like Hong Kong or central Tokyo, where transit dominates and\ncar access is minimal, the commercial role of vehicle presence may be negligible or even\nnegative. Likewise, in auto-dependent suburban areas of North America, the absence of\npedestrians is often structural, and the vitality logic differs entirely.↳\nOur findings also contribute to the policy debate on whether and how to open gated\ncommunities. While greater permeability may increase customer access, it also risks exposing\nresidential areas to cut-through traffic. Our results suggest that slow, deliberate vehicle\npresence supports commerce, while fast-moving through-traffic detracts from street quality.\nIf communities are to be opened, design elements such as traffic calming, green buffers, and\nclear pedestrian paths will be critical in shaping outcomes.\nFinally, the success of multimodal AI tools in this research demonstrates their promise\nfor urban planning. Models like VisualGLM can support large-scale, fine-grained analysis of\nperceptual variables such as cleanliness or spatial openness, helping cities identify target\nzones for intervention. As these models improve, planners and policymakers will have\ngreater capacity to link visual urban form to social and economic outcomes—expanding the\npossibilities for data-informed, human-centered urban design.\n6. Conclusion and Policy Directions\nThis study represents an initial attempt to investigate how the presence of motor vehicles\n—specifically parked cars and parking infrastructure—interacts with streetscape conditions\nto shape community-level commercial vitality. By combining street-view image analysis with\nmultimodal AI modeling, we explored not only the role of vehicle-related variables, but also a\nset of environmental factors including greenery, cleanliness, and street width, using Harbin\nas a case.\nOur preliminary results suggest that vehicle presence is not uniformly positive or\nnegative. In some communities, a moderate level of car accessibility appears to coincide with\nhigher commercial activity, while in others, excessive curbside parking or poorly managed\ntraffic detracts from walkability and shop appeal. Similarly, street greenery and cleanliness\nwere consistently associated with higher resident satisfaction, but their effect on shop pricing\nwas less pronounced. Instead, sidewalk and roadway width — factors related to physical\naccessibility and spatial comfort—appeared to be more directly correlated with commercial\npricing indicators.\nPerhaps most intriguing are the conditional effects we observed: for example, the impact\nof vehicle concentration seems to depend on street width, with negative pricing effects on\nnarrow streets and more complex dynamics on wider ones. These patterns hint at interactive\nmechanisms between vehicular access, spatial configuration, and retail behavior — but our\ncurrent model cannot yet confirm their robustness or isolate causal channels. Further work is\nneeded to rigorously test these hypotheses.\nFrom a methodological standpoint, this study also tested the feasibility of using\nmultimodal models (such as VisualGLM) for perceptual feature extraction—e.g., interpreting\nstreet cleanliness or parking intensity from imagery. While still experimental, our approach\nsuggests that AI-driven urban observation may offer a scalable tool for capturing subtle\nenvironmental qualities that are otherwise difficult to quantify.\nHowever, several limitations must be acknowledged. First, the analysis is based on a\nstatic dataset of street-view images, which only offer a single temporal snapshot. Second, the\ncommercial vitality indicators we used— such as shop review counts or pricing data from\nonline platforms—are imperfect proxies and may reflect longer-term patterns that lag behind\nphysical changes. Third, sample size, annotation noise, and model interpretability all\nintroduce uncertainty at this stage.\nTherefore, the current paper is best read as a foundation for ongoing experimentation\nand model refinement. Rather than answering a specific question conclusively, it raises\nseveral important inquiries:\n(1)\nUnder what spatial conditions does car access enhance or undermine local\ncommerce?\n(2)\nHow do environmental features (e.g., greening or width) mediate this effect?\n(3)\nAre there thresholds or tipping points at which vehicle presence becomes harmful?\n(4)\nCan multimodal models be tuned to consistently detect qualitative street traits?\n(5)\nHow might a temporal or longitudinal dataset (e.g., time-series foot traffic or sales)\nchange these findings?\nAnswering these questions will require future work incorporating dynamic data, more\ndiverse community samples, and perhaps participatory inputs from residents or business\nowners. Still, our exploratory\nfindings\nalready offer valuable\ndirection: community\ncommercial streets are shaped not only by accessibility, but by the spatial and perceptual\nlogic that frames that access. Cars may bring people—but it is the quality of the environment\nthat encourages people to stay, linger, and return.\nAs a next step, we envision follow-up experiments focusing on:\n(1)\nControlled\ncomparison\nstudies\n(e.g.,\nbefore – after\nparking\nor\ngreening\ninterventions),\n(2)\nExpanded annotation datasets for training cleaner multimodal models,\n(3)\nCross-city validation to test generalizability across climate and culture,\n(4)\nAnd temporal AI integration, such as using sequential images or video to track\nchanging vitality.\nFor policymakers and urban planners, this early-stage research suggests the need to\nthink beyond binary debates like “cars vs. pedestrians.” Instead, the core question may be:\nhow can cars be accommodated without eroding the very qualities that make community\nstreets vibrant in the first place? This study offers a conceptual and technical starting point for\nexploring that balance.\nReferences\n1.\nMouratidis K, Poortinga W.

What are the core contents and main contributions of this paper?\n\nThe core content of this paper is to study how street-level features in Harbin (such as parking density, greenery, cleanliness, and street width) affect community business vitality and user satisfaction. By combining street-view images with multi-modal large language models (VisualGLM-6B), the authors developed a Community Commercial Vitality Index (CCVI) and analyzed its relationship with spatial attributes extracted through GPT-4-based perception modeling.\n\nThe main contributions include:\n- Proposing an interpretable, image-based framework to investigate the impact of street-level features on commercial performance and user satisfaction.\n- Revealing that moderate vehicle presence may enhance commercial accessibility, but excessive roadside parking erodes walkability and reduces satisfaction as well as store pricing.\n- Demonstrating that street greenery and cleanliness significantly improve satisfaction scores but have weaker associations with pricing.\n- Highlighting that street width moderates the effects of vehicle presence, emphasizing the importance of spatial configuration.\n\n---\n\n### 2.
