    "summary": "The study, which analyzed a corpus of 735 online counseling dialogues, found that the frequency of negative emotional words was significantly positively correlated with depressive and anxious states. In contrast, the frequency of first-person singular pronouns showed no significant association with psychological states, highlighting the influence of cultural and conversational context on the language used in mental health communication.",
    "abstract": "This study explores the relationship between linguistic expressions and psychological states of depression and anxiety within Chinese psycho-counseling interactions, focusing specifically on the usage of first-person singular pronouns and negative emotional words. Utilizing a corpus derived from 735 online counseling sessions, the analysis employed a general linear mixed-effect model to assess linguistic patterns quantified by the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) software. Results indicate a significant positive correlation between the frequency of negative emotional words and the severity of both depressive and anxious states among clients. However, contrary to prior findings predominantly derived from English-language contexts, the usage frequency of first-person singular pronouns did not vary significantly with the clients' psychological conditions. These outcomes are discussed within the framework of cultural distinctions between collectivist Chinese contexts and individualistic Western settings, as well as the interactive dynamics unique to psycho-counseling conversations. The findings highlight the nuanced influence of cultural and conversational contexts on language use in mental health communications, providing insights into psycholinguistic markers relevant to therapeutic practices in Chinese-speaking populations.",

The current work belongs to part of \"Xihu-xinlin\" online psycho-counseling\nresearch.\nDEPRESSIVE AND ANXIOUS EXPRESSIONS\n2\nThe Expressions of Depression and Anxiety in Chinese Psycho-counseling: Usage of First\nPerson Singular Pronoun and Negative Emotional Words\nAs early as the beginning of the 20th century, Sigmund Freud, the originator of the psycho-\ntherapeutic approach to psychoanalysis, suggested that individuals’ habits of speech, slips of the\ntongue, and other linguistic expressions to a certain extent represent people’s subconscious\nhidden motives or concerns (Freud, 1989). In psycho-counselling, clients mainly talk to the\ncounselor about their difficulties through linguistic expressions, and recent studies have also\nshown that individuals’ verbal expressions often reflect their current psychological and cognitive\nstates (Pennebaker et al., 2003). And an individual’s depression or anxiety can be expressed\nthrough words, such as the publication of texts on social media (Bathina et al., 2021;\nCoppersmith et al., 2015; Qiu et al., 2012)，thematic writing of emotion (Huang et al., 2019;\nSmirnova et al., 2018). For example, compare to the healthy control, individuals with depressive\nor anxious tendencies or symptoms use more the first person singular pronoun, negative emotion\nwords, negatives, tentative words etc.(Miner et al., 2022; O’Dea et al., 2021; Qiu et al., 2012;\nSmirnova et al., 2018; Wei et al., 2021). However, most of such studies have been conducted in\nEnglish contexts, and those in Chinese contexts have focused on unilateral text postings by users\non social media platforms, rather than interactive dialogues between counselors and clients in the\ncontext of psycho-counselling (Cheng et al., 2017; Li et al., 2020).\nIn existing studies that have explored psycho-counselling dialogues, researchers quantified\nlinguistic expressions in psycho-counsellings through the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count\nDictionary (LIWC) (Lin et al., 2020; Tausczik & Pennebaker, 2010) and analyzed their\nrelationship with subjectively rated counselling effectiveness by the clients (Althoff et al., 2016).\nIn the psycho-counselings, clients and counselors discussed the past and present in the first and\nDEPRESSIVE AND ANXIOUS EXPRESSIONS\n3\nmiddle stages of counselings, and explored the future in the later stage of counselings.\nMeanwhile, the clients usually used more negative emotional words in the first stage of\ncounselings, and increased the use of positive emotional words in the later stage of counselings.\nMoreover, the clients who expressed more future-related and positive emotional vocabulary in\nthe latter part of the counselings tended to perceived the psycho-counselling as more effective in\nsoothing their emotional feelings compared to those who expressed less of this type of words.\nNotably, the depressed clients used more first-person pronouns and anxious clients used more\nquantifiers for their expressions compared to those who had a normal mental state (Miner et al.,\n2022; Wei et al., 2021). Thus, the clients’ linguistic expressions in psycho-counselings can be\nquantified to a certain extent by means of psychologically meaningful vocabulary and are linked\nto their subjective feelings (Freud, 1989).\nAlthough little research of Chinese psycho-counseling has systematically explored the\ncharacteristics of linguistic expressions in the counseling dialogues related to depression and\nanxiety states, and whether linguistic expressions change with the level of depression and anxiety\nof individuals (Malgaroli et al., 2023), it has been shown that an individual’s expressions change\nas their physical and mental health state changes. Campbell and Pennebaker (2003) found that\nchanges in an individual’s writing style correlated with their level of physical fitness. Their\nexperiment correlated the semantic similarity between participants’ consecutive emotional\nwritings or writings about traumatic events with their number of trips to the hospital for medical\ncheckups. The results showed that the smaller the similarity in stylistic semantic space and\npersonal pronoun semantic space between each of the participants’ writings, the lower the\nnumber of trips they made to the hospital, indicating a higher degree of improvement in their\nhealth status. The phenomenon of an individual’s writing style changing in response to\nDEPRESSIVE AND ANXIOUS EXPRESSIONS\n4\nindividual’s state of physical health also provides evidence that an individuals’ physical and\nmental improvement is reflected in changes in the cognitive styles (Beck, 1979).\nHowever, existing research is limited to the psycho-counseling in the Western English\ncontext or social media publishing in the Chinese context, and barely address the field of Chinese\npsycho-counselings. Moreover, specific expressions in the Chinese context, such as subject\nomission (Chen, 2009), and different attitudes toward emotions between Chinese and Westerners,\nsuch as the tendency of Easterners to express emotions in a calm manner while Westerners tend\nto express emotions in an agitated manner (Lim, 2016), may differentiate linguistic expressions\nin the Chinese context from the English context. Therefore, in order to explore the linguistic\nexpressions affected by the degree of depression and anxiety in the Chinese psycho-counseling\ncontext, the current study focuses on comparing the differences in the use of first-person singular\nand negative emotional words in the Chinese psycho-counseling for clients with different\ndegrees of depression and anxiety.\nMethod\nCounseling Setting and Design\nAn online platform called ’Xinling’ was employed to collect all the psycho-counseling\ndialogues. The platform was developed by Deep Learning Lab of Westlake University and\ndesigned specially for the service of online text-based psycho-counselings. The data collected by\nthe platform were stored on the Ali Cloud encrypted by Advanced Encryption Standard 256\nalgorithm (AliClound, 2023).\nThe design of the experimental setting included setting for both client and counselors. For\nthe clients, they were encouraged to complete at least seven consecutive online psycho-\ncounselling sessions, with no more than two weeks between sessions to ensure effectiveness\nDEPRESSIVE AND ANXIOUS EXPRESSIONS\n5\n(Kadera et al., 1996). They would receive participation fee after attending 10 consecutive online\npsycho-counselling sessions free of charge. At the same time, before the start of each counselling\nsession, the clients should fill in the Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS, Zung, 1971) and Self-rating\nDepression Scale (SDS, Zung, 1965) to reflect their depression and anxiety status in the past\nweek, meanwhile, they could also pay for the counseling if they wished to continue after the 10\nsessions. For the counselors, they were also informed that they would give at least 7 online text-\nbased psycho-counselings to each client and the clients would fill SAS and SDS at the start of\ncounselings. The counselors were also required to provide the online text-based counselings as\nprofessional as face-to-face counselings. For both clients and counselors, they were informed\nthat they could cease the counselling or require transfer anytime after the counselings started.\nThe research project was granted ethics approval by the Westlake University Research Ethics\nCommittee (20220519LZZ001).\nParticipants Recruitment\nClient\nAll the participants were recruited via advertising, word-of-mouth and snow-balling.\nConsidering the limitations of online text-based counseling in terms of dealing with mental\ndisorders and crisis situations (Haque & Rubya, 2022), the recruitment contained two\nstages to ensure all the participants were suitable for the online text-based counseling. At the first\nstage, all the individuals signed up for the study were required to complete the\nself-report symptom inventory (SCL-90) (Derogatis et al., 1973; Wang et al., 1999) to\nconfirm that the participants were not suffering from severe psychological problems and\npsychiatric symptoms. As a result, 163 individuals signed up but eight of them failed to\ncomplete the checklist. Another seven of them were excluded due to their T scores of\nDEPRESSIVE AND ANXIOUS EXPRESSIONS\n6\ndepression, anxiety or psychiatric symptoms were above 2.5, indicating mild to severe level of\npsychological problems (Wang et al., 1999). Meanwhile, the seven individuals were suggested\nto visit the clinic for a professional check.\nAt the second stage, researchers with psychological background contacted the rest\n148 individuals one by one via phone call to further examine their mental health condition and\nmotivation of participation; meanwhile, the researchers also introduced the procedure of the\nstudy and acquire consents from the individuals who decided to participate.\nConsequently, 46 individuals were excluded from the study (21 were only curious about the\nstudy and did not have any issues to discuss with psycho-counselors, 13 were unable to\nparticipate due to time clash, 10 were having ongoing psycho-counselings or medical\ntreatments, 2 lost of contact). Thus, 102 participants were recruited to attend the online\ncounselling after the two stages. Although 20 of them dropped out as the counselings\nproceeded (19 due to time clash, 1 transfer), 82 adult participants completed the entire study (55\nfemales, 19- to 54-year-olds, M = 27.62years, SD = 5.94) and received 300 Chinese Yuan for\nparticipation.\nCounsellor\nWe invited nine qualified counselors1 to participate the current research (7 females, 25- to\n45-year-olds, M = 34.67years, SD = 7.45). Three of them were experienced psycho-counselors\nwith over 10 years’ and 4000 hours’ counseling experience (professional), another three were\nsenior counselors with over 5 years’ and at least 400 hours’ experience (senior), the rest three\nwere junior counselors with counseling experience less than 5 years and 300 hours (junior).\nEach psycho-counselor received reasonable participation fee based on the level of experience\n1 Seven counselors hold the national practitioners’ certificates of psycho-counselling or psychotherapy; two junior\ncounsellor had completed professional counselling training for at least 200 hours and accomplished more than 100\nhours’ counselings independently under supervision before participated the current research.\nDEPRESSIVE AND ANXIOUS EXPRESSIONS\n7\nand the amount of counselings they completed. All the clients and counselors gave their consent\nto participate in the current research, use the data collected for non-profit academic research and\nreceived participation fee.\nIn the end, we collected 859 counselings in total of which 735 counselings with depression\n(M = 49.52, SD = 12.83) and anxiety (M = 44.88 , SD = 8.21) scores reported (Table 1). The\nfollowing analyses were based on the 735 counselings.\nQuantify First-person Singular Pronoun and Negative Emotional Words\nClients’ expressions of first person pronoun and negative emotional words were quantified\nby LIWC-22 software (Boyd et al., 2022) using the simplified Chinese LIWC dictionary (Lin et\nal., 2020) based on the frequency (e.g., the number of fist-person pronouns/the entire words\nclients typed in one counseling session).\nTable 1\nThe Descriptive Information of the Collected Counsellings\nDEPRESSIVE AND ANXIOUS EXPRESSIONS\n8\nResult\nWe employed general linear mixed effect model (GLMEM) to exam the relations between\nclients’ usage of first-person singular pronoun, negative emotional words and their degree of\ndepression and anxiety. Data were analyzed in RStudio (version 2023.06.0; Allaire, 2012). We\nused the lmer function from the lme4 package to fit linear mixed- effect models (LMEMs) in R\n(Douglas Bates et al., 2015). Generally speaking, we fitted the different models with clients’\nusage frequency of first-person singular pronoun or negative\nemotional words as dependent\nvariable, clients’ depression or anxiety scores as independent variable, and by-clients, by-\ncounselors random intercepts. In the result section, first, we reported the result of whether\nclients’ usage of first-person singular pronoun and negative emotional words change with\ndepression degree, then those change with anxiety degree.\nThe Relation between First-person Singular pronoun and Depression\nThe result of GLMEM with the frequency of first-person singular pronoun as dependent\nvariable shows that the usage frequency of first-person singular pronoun (M = 5.31 , SD = 2.27)\nhas no relation with depression scores (χ 2(1) = 1.16, p = .28), indicating the clients used similar\namount of first-person pronoun no matter how depressive they were (see Figure 1).\nDEPRESSIVE AND ANXIOUS EXPRESSIONS\n9\nFigure 1\nThe Trend of First-person Singular Pronoun and Negative Emotional Words Based on\nDepression Score\nNote. The black dots represent the individual data points of each clients in each\ncounseling sessions.\nThe Relation between Negative Emotional Words and Depression\nThe model with the frequency of negative emotional words as dependent variable shows\nthat the usage of negative emotional words (M = 5.37 , SD = 1.89) relates to clients’ depression\nscore positively (χ2(1) = 15.77, p < .001), indicating the more depressive the clients were, the\nmore negative emotional words they expressed in the psycho-counseling (see Figure 1).\nThe Relation between First-person Singular Pronoun and Anxiety\nSimilarly, the model with the frequency of first-person singular pronoun as dependent\nvariable shows no significant relation between the frequency of first-person singular pronoun and\nDEPRESSIVE AND ANXIOUS EXPRESSIONS\n10\nclients’ anxiety score (χ 2(1) = 0.15, p = .69), indicating the clients used similar amount of first-\nperson singular pronoun regardless of how anxious they were in the Chinese psycho-counseling\n(see Figure 2).\nThe Relation between Negative Emotional Words and Anxiety\nThe model with the frequency of negative emotional words as dependent variable shows\nthat the usage of negative emotional words relates to clients’ anxiety score positively (χ2(1) =\n8.66, p = .003), indicating the more anxious the clients were, the more negative emotional words\nthey expressed in the psycho-counseling (see Figure 2).\nFigure 2\nThe Trend of First-person Singular Pronoun and Negative Emotional Words Based on\nAnxiety Score\nNote. The black dots represent the individual data points of each clients in each\ncounseling sessions.\nDEPRESSIVE AND ANXIOUS EXPRESSIONS IN CHINESE COUNSELINGS\n4\nDiscussion\nThe current work analyzed whether the use of the first-person singular and negative\nemotional words differed between clients in different states of depression and anxiety in a\nChinese online counseling conversation setting, and found that the more severe the level of\ndepression and anxiety, the more emotional negatively the clients viewed and described things,\nbut that the use of the first-person singular was not affected by the level of depression and\nanxiety of the clients. We discussed the former finding from the perspectives of therapeutic\nencouragement to express emotions during psycho-counseling and human nature to express\nnegative emotions, and the later findings from the aspects of cultural differences between\nwestern and eastern world as well as conversational dynamics in psycho-counseling.\nTherapeutic Encouragement and Human Nature to Express Negative Emotions\nOn one hand, counselors and psychotherapists often encourage clients to articulate their\nfeelings as part of the healing process. This encouragement is grounded in the belief that\nverbalizing emotions can help clients process their experiences(Jacobson, 1994), gain insight\ninto their emotional states (Greenberg et al., 2008), and develop coping strategies(Trappler &\nNewville, 2007). In the context of depression and anxiety, where individuals may experience\nintense and overwhelming negative emotions, counselors might specifically prompt clients to\ndescribe these feelings(Ehrhardt et al., 1989), facilitating clients to confront and manage their\nemotions more effectively. On the other hand, from a humanistic perspective, expressing\nnegative emotions can serve as a form of emotional catharsis, releasing pent-up emotional\ntension(Kashdan et al., 2007; Lieberman & Goldstein, 2006). For individuals experiencing\ndepression and anxiety, articulating these feelings can provide a sense of relief and reduce the\nburden of carrying these emotions internally, for instance, expressing anger facilitates the\nDEPRESSIVE AND ANXIOUS EXPRESSIONS IN CHINESE COUNSELINGS\n4\nimprovement of life quality and decreases the feelings of depression (Kashdan et al., 2007).\nMeanwhile, expressing negative emotions is a way to seek connection and support. When\nindividuals verbalize their distress, they are not only processing their own emotions (Greenberg,\n2014) but also\nsignaling their need for understanding and empathy (Graham et al., 2008). The\nact of expression itself, especially in a supportive and understanding environment, as in the\npsycho-counselings, can be therapeutic.\nCultural Differences, Conversational Dynamics in Psycho-counseling and First-person\nsingular Pronoun\nA meta-analysis review (Oyserman et al., 2002) reported that Western cultures often\nemphasize individualism, where personal identity and expressions are strongly tied to individual\nexperiences. This can reflect in language use, where first-person singular pronouns become a\ntool to assert individuality, especially in contexts discussing personal emotional states. Eastern\ncultures, including Chinese society, are more collectivist, focusing on the group and social\nharmony. Even in expressing personal distress, the linguistic style may prioritize a more\ncollective or indirect approach, minimizing the focus on the self even when discussing personal\nissues. In terms of conversational dynamics in psycho-counseling, the psycho-counseling\ninvolves a directed, purposeful conversation between a client and a therapist, where the focus is\non the client’s thoughts, feelings, and experiences (Beck, 2020). Social media postings, however,\nare more about broadcasting to an audience, seeking validation, attention, or sharing information\n(Lyons et al., 2018). This difference in interaction nature could explain why the first-person\nsingular usage doesn’t increase with depression and anxiety severity in counseling settings. The\nconversational dynamic in counseling already centers around the client, making the excessive\nuse of \"I\" unnecessary to emphasize their personal experience or to seek attention.\nDEPRESSIVE AND ANXIOUS EXPRESSIONS IN CHINESE COUNSELINGS\n4\nThe present study elucidates that within the ambit of Chinese psycho-counseling, clients\nmanifested an increase in the expression of negative emotions concurrent with heightened levels\nof depression and anxiety. Contrary to prior research, which posited an augmented utilization of\nfirst-person singular pronouns as indicative of depressive and anxious states in the context of\nEnglish-speaking counseling sessions and social media interactions, such linguistic patterns do\nnot appear to serve as reliable markers of depression or anxiety within the Chinese psycho-\ncounseling framework. These findings underscore a distinct communicative function of social\nmedia VS psycho-counseling and may further reflect the underlying cultural dichotomies\nbetween the individualism prevalent in Western societies and the collectivism characteristic of\nChinese culture.\nDEPRESSIVE AND ANXIOUS EXPRESSIONS IN CHINESE COUNSELINGS\n4\nReferences\nAllaire, J.

Core Content and Main Contributions of the Paper\n\n### Core Content:\nThe paper, titled **\"The Expressions of Depression and Anxiety in Chinese Psycho-counseling: Usage of First-person Singular Pronoun and Negative Emotional Words\"**, focuses on **linguistic features of depression and anxiety in Chinese psycho-counseling services**, particularly analyzing the relationship between the **use of first-person singular pronouns** (e.g., \"我\" — \"I\") and **negative emotional words** and clients' psychological states.\n\nThe study is based on real conversation data collected from an online psycho-counseling platform called \"Xinling\" (Mind), and uses psychological assessment tools (SAS, SDS) to evaluate clients' levels of anxiety and depression. It also applies the **LIWC-22** tool to quantitatively analyze linguistic features.\n\n### Main Contributions:\n1. **Fills a research gap in psycho-counseling language studies within the Chinese context**: Most similar studies have focused on English or non-interactive texts from social media, while this research systematically analyzes linguistic features in Chinese psycho-counseling dialogues for the first time.\n2. **Reveals a positive correlation between negative emotional words and levels of depression/anxiety**: Clients with higher levels of depression or anxiety tend to use more negative emotional words.\n3. **Challenges traditional views**: In the Chinese context, the use of first-person singular pronouns does **not** significantly increase with higher levels of depression or anxiety, contrasting with findings in Western studies.\n4. **Provides linguistic support for mental health assessment**: The findings offer theoretical foundations for natural language processing (NLP)-based systems for automatic psychological state detection.\n\n---\n\n## II. Breakthroughs and Innovations in the Paper\n\n### 1. **Contextual Innovation: First Focus on Chinese Psycho-counseling Dialogues**\n- Most research focuses on non-interactive texts from social media (e.g., tweets, Weibo posts), while this paper systematically analyzes **Chinese online psycho-counseling dialogues**, which are more interactive and contextually authentic.\n- It provides a **therapeutic context-based linguistic pattern**, contributing to understanding language features in real psychological intervention settings.\n\n### 2. **Analysis of Language Use from a Cultural Differences Perspective**\n- It highlights that in the Chinese context, the use of first-person pronouns **does not increase with rising levels of depression or anxiety**, which contrasts sharply with findings from Western studies.\n- It emphasizes the influence of **cultural differences** (e.g., collectivism vs. individualism) on language expression, offering new perspectives for cross-cultural psycholinguistic research.\n\n### 3. **Methodological Innovation**\n- Uses **LIWC-22** combined with a Chinese dictionary to quantitatively analyze linguistic features, enhancing scientific rigor and reproducibility.\n- Employs **Generalized Linear Mixed Effects Models** (GLMEM) to control for individual differences and therapist influence, strengthening the robustness of statistical analysis.\n\n---\n\n## III. Entrepreneurial Project Suggestions (Based on the Paper's Core Findings)\n\n### 1. **NLP-Based AI Assessment System for Online Psycho-counseling**\n- **Project Name**: MindTalk AI Psychological Assessment Platform\n- **Function**: Automatically assesses users' levels of depression and anxiety by analyzing linguistic features (e.g., frequency of negative emotional words, first-person pronouns) in counseling dialogues.\n- **Technical Implementation**: Combines LIWC Chinese dictionary + NLP models (e.g., BERT) for emotion recognition and psychological state modeling.\n- **Market Value**: Offers **automated risk assessment and intervention suggestions** for counseling platforms, improving service efficiency and quality.\n\n### 2. **AI-Powered Personalized Psychological Support Chatbot**\n- **Project Name**: Xiao Xinyu Psychological Assistant\n- **Function**: Develop a dialogue-based AI psychological assistant that identifies users' emotional states through language features and provides **personalized emotional support suggestions**.\n- **Technical Implementation**: Integrates emotion recognition models, dialogue generation models (e.g., ChatGPT), and psychological intervention strategy databases.\n- **Application Scenarios**: Suitable for universities, corporate EAP programs, and mental health apps as an auxiliary tool for psychological hotlines.\n\n### 3. **Language Expression Training System for Psycho-counselors**\n- **Project Name**: MindTalk Training Camp\n- **Function**: Provides a **language expression feedback system** for psycho-counselors, analyzing whether their language effectively guides emotional expression and uses appropriate linguistic styles.\n- **Technical Implementation**: Builds a language style evaluation model to offer real-time feedback and improvement suggestions.\n- **Market Value**: Enhances the professional competence of psycho-counselors, suitable for use in counseling training institutions or as a teaching aid in university psychology departments.\n\n### 4. **Mental Health Content Creation Platform**\n- **Project Name**: HeartVoice Community\n- **Function**: Encourages users to express emotions through writing or voice recordings, with the platform automatically analyzing language features and providing **mental health status feedback and suggestions**.\n- **Technical Implementation**: Integrates a language emotion analysis engine and generates mental health reports based on user content.\n- **Social Value**: Builds a safe, private emotional expression community, raising public awareness of mental health.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis paper not only reveals linguistic patterns of depression and anxiety in the context of Chinese psycho-counseling, but also provides a solid theoretical foundation and technical direction for the mental health technology field. Based on its findings, multiple AI-driven mental health projects with both **social impact and commercial potential** can be developed, promoting the **intelligence and personalization** of mental health services.",
