    "summary": "Based on the project description you provided, here is the English translation of the content (in Markdown format):\n\n---\n\n## 1. Core Content and Problems Solved\n\n**Core Content:**  \nPolar is an open-source payment infrastructure engine designed to help developers quickly build and sell SaaS or other digital products. It provides a complete backend solution for payments, subscriptions, and customer management, allowing developers to focus on product development instead of rebuilding payment systems from scratch.\n\n**Main Problems Solved:**\n\n- Developers often need to build their own payment, subscription, invoicing, and tax systems when launching digital products ‚Äî a process that is costly and complex.\n- The sales process for digital products is cumbersome, involving customer account management, license distribution, file downloads, and access control (e.g., to Discord).\n- Handling global tax issues (e.g., VAT, Sales Tax) is complicated and error-prone.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Breakthroughs and Innovations\n\n- **Full-stack Open Source + Developer-friendly:**  \n  Offers complete frontend and backend codebases (Python + FastAPI + Next.js), making it easy for developers to customize and integrate.\n  \n- **All-in-One Platform for Selling Digital Products:**  \n  Supports selling a wide range of digital goods such as GitHub repository access, Discord support channels, downloadable files, and license keys.\n\n- **Automated Global Tax Handling:**  \n  Polar acts as the \"Merchant of Record,\" automatically handling VAT, Sales Tax, and other tax requirements, reducing the developer‚Äôs burden.\n\n- **Low Transaction Fees + No Monthly Fee:**  \n  Charges only 4% + $0.40 per transaction, with no fixed monthly fee ‚Äî ideal for indie developers and startups.\n\n- **Rich API and SDK Ecosystem:**  \n  Provides SDKs for multiple languages (e.g., JavaScript, Python) and webhook support, making it easy to integrate into existing projects.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Startup Ideas Based on Polar\n\n1. **Developer Tools Marketplace:**  \n   Build a platform where developers can upload tools, libraries, and templates, and use Polar to manage automated sales and subscriptions.\n\n2. **AI Model-as-a-Service (MaaS) Platform:**  \n   Integrate AI models uploaded by developers and use Polar to charge users based on API calls or subscription plans.\n\n3. **Knowledge Monetization & Online Course Platform:**  \n   Use Polar to sell online courses, e-books, and code packages, and offer student support through Discord.\n\n4. **Commercialization Tool for Open Source Projects:**  \n   Create a \"Sponsor-as-a-Subscription\" platform for open source projects, where users pay to access premium features, priority support, or exclusive content.\n\n5. **Low-code/No-code Digital Product Store:**  \n   Offer visual tools to help non-technical users create digital products (e.g., templates, config files) and use Polar for monetization.\n\n6. **Developer Membership Subscription Platform:**  \n   Provide a platform where users can subscribe to access private GitHub repositories, tools, and Discord communities from multiple developers.\n\n---\n\n> **Summary:**  \nPolar provides developers with a powerful open-source payment infrastructure, ideal for building digital product marketplaces or SaaS platforms. With Polar, entrepreneurs can rapidly launch their projects and focus on core innovation, without reinventing the wheel.",
