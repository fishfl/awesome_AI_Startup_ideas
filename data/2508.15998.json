Nguyen, Member, IEEE, Md Raihan Uddin, Shaba Shaon, Ratun Rahman,\nOctavia Dobre, Fellow, IEEE, and Dusit Niyato, Fellow, IEEE\nAbstract—Quantum federated learning (QFL) is a combination\nof distributed quantum computing and federated machine learn-\ning, integrating the strengths of both to enable privacy-preserving\ndecentralized learning with quantum-enhanced capabilities. It\nappears as a promising approach for addressing challenges in\nefficient and secure model training across distributed quantum\nsystems. This paper presents a comprehensive survey on QFL, ex-\nploring its key concepts, fundamentals, applications, and emerg-\ning challenges in this rapidly developing field. Specifically, we\nbegin with an introduction to the recent advancements of QFL,\nfollowed by discussion on its market opportunity and background\nknowledge. We then discuss the motivation behind the integration\nof quantum computing and federated learning, highlighting its\nworking principle. Moreover, we review the fundamentals of QFL\nand its taxonomy. Particularly, we explore federation architec-\nture, networking topology, communication schemes, optimization\ntechniques, and security mechanisms within QFL frameworks.\nFurthermore, we investigate applications of QFL across several\ndomains which include vehicular networks, healthcare networks,\nsatellite networks, metaverse, and network security. Additionally,\nwe analyze frameworks and platforms related to QFL, delving\ninto its prototype implementations, and provide a detailed case\nstudy. Key insights and lessons learned from this review of QFL\nare also highlighted. We complete the survey by identifying\ncurrent challenges and outlining potential avenues for future\nresearch in this rapidly advancing field.\nIndex Terms—Quantum federated learning (QFL), quantum\ncommunications and networking, quantum security.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nQuantum computing holds the potential to revolutionize\ncomputation by offering exponential speedups for certain\nclasses of problems that are intractable for classical computers.\nThis promise has attracted considerable attention from sci-\nentific, industrial, and governmental communities. However,\nthe current state of quantum hardware, known as the Noisy\nIntermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era, is characterized by\ndevices that have limited qubit counts, short coherence times,\nand high error rates. As a result, many complex quantum\napplications, such as quantum chemistry simulations—remain\nout of reach. These applications often require hundreds or even\nthousands of qubits to represent complex molecular systems\naccurately, as demonstrated in recent studies [1], [2], far\nexceeding the capabilities of existing NISQ systems.\nDinh C. Nguyen, Md Raihand Uddin, Shaba Shaon, and Ratun Rahman\nare with the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, The\nUniversity of Alabama in Huntsville, USA (e-mails: dinh.nguyen@uah.edu,\nmu0016@uah.edu, ss0670@uah.edu, rr0110@uah.edu).\nOctavia Dobre is with the Faculty of Engineering and Applied Science,\nMemorial University, Canada (e-mail: odobre@mun.ca).\nDusit Niyato is with the College of Computer Science and Engineering,\nNanyang Technological University, Singapore (e-mail: dniyato@ntu.edu.sg).\nTo address these limitations, Distributed Quantum Comput-\ning (DQC) has emerged as a promising architectural approach\n[3]–[5]. DQC envisions a network of interconnected small-\nto moderate-scale quantum processors that collaboratively\nexecute computational tasks. Rather than relying on a single\nlarge quantum computer, DQC leverages modular quantum\ndevices, potentially located across different physical locations,\nand links them through quantum communication channels.\nThis paradigm enables the aggregation of quantum resources,\neffectively scaling the number of usable qubits and allowing\nfor more sophisticated quantum algorithms to be implemented\nunder the constraints of NISQ hardware.\nWithin this DQC framework, quantum federated learn-\ning (QFL) has emerged as a key enabling paradigm. QFL\nintegrates principles of quantum computing with federated\nmachine learning, allowing multiple quantum devices to jointly\ntrain QML models without sharing raw quantum data [6]. This\napproach not only enhances privacy and data locality but also\naligns naturally with the distributed structure of DQC. By\ncoordinating the training process across various NISQ devices,\nQFL makes it feasible to tackle large-scale data processing\ntasks and QML workloads that would otherwise exceed the\ncapacity of individual quantum processors [7]. Moreover,\nQFL introduces a scalable mechanism to effectively distribute\nthe computational load and improve resource utilization in\nquantum networks. As the demand for quantum-enhanced\nmachine learning grows across domains such as scientific\ncomputing, drug discovery, cybersecurity, and financial mod-\neling, the importance of scalable and collaborative quantum\nintelligence becomes increasingly evident. QFL represent a\nforward-looking solution that bridges the current hardware\nlimitations of the NISQ era and opens pathways for practical,\nnear-term quantum applications [8].\nA. State-of-the-Art and Our Contributions\nA number of studies have explored the landscape of\nQFL, summarized in Table II highlighting key developments,\nchallenges, and future directions in this emerging field. For\ninstance, [3], [9], [10] provide a valuable survey of the\nchallenges and opportunities in the emerging field of QFL\nfrom a computer and communications engineering perspec-\ntive. Their work effectively outlines the key findings and\nfuture directions for the field. While acknowledging this\nimportant contribution, our survey provides a distinct and\ncomplementary direction by offering a more granular and\nstructured approach. Specifically, our work differentiates itself\narXiv:2508.15998v1  [cs.LG]  21 Aug 2025\nIEEE COMMUNICATIONS SURVEYS & TUTORIALS\nTable I: List of key Acronyms.\nAcronym\nDefinition\nAI\nArtificial Intelligence\nBQC\nBlind Quantum Computing\nCQFL\nCentralized Quantum Federated Learning\nDQFL\nDecentralized Quantum Federated Learning\nFL\nFederated Learning\nFSO\nFree Space Optical\nHQFL\nHybrid Quantum Federated Learning\nHQKD\nHierarchical Quantum Key Distribution\nIoT\nInternet of Things\nIoQT\nInternet of Quantum Things\nML\nMachine Learning\nNN\nNeural Network\nNISQ\nNoisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum\nP2P\npeer-to–peer\nPQC\nParameterized Quantum Circuit\nQC\nQuantum Computing\nQCNN\nQuantum Convolutional Neural Network\nQCC\nQuantum-Classical Computing\nQDP\nQuantum Differential Privacy\nQEC\nQuantum Error Correction\nQECC\nQuantum Error Correction Codes\nQED\nQuantum Error Detection\nQFL\nQuantum Federated Learning\nQML\nQuantum Machine Learning\nQHE\nQuantum Homomorphic Encryption\nQKD\nQuantum Key Distribution\nQML\nQuantum Machine Learning\nQNN\nQuantum Neural Network\nQSN\nQuantum Satellite Networks\nQVQE\nQuantum Variational Quantum Eigensolver\nQVN\nQuantum Vehicular Networks\nUAV\nUnmanned Aerial Vehicle\nVQA\nVariational Quantum Algorithm\nVQC\nVariational Quantum Circuit\nVQE\nVariational Quantum Eigensolver\nby presenting a comprehensive, multi-layered taxonomy of\nQFL systems, covering architectures, networking topologies,\ncommunication schemes, and optimization strategies in greater\ndepth. Furthermore, we provide a dedicated analysis of market\nand industry developments and include a practical case study\nto demonstrate the implementation of QFL with current frame-\nworks. We design this approach not only to provide a high-\nlevel overview but also to equip researchers and practitioners\nwith a detailed, foundational understanding and a guide to\ntangible implementation, thereby filling a critical gap in the\nexisting literature. The researchers in [11], [12] offered an\nintroduction to quantum computing and its effects on the\nfield of communications, reviewing key advancements and\nessential elements of quantum internet. They also investigated\nthe challenges of designing the quantum internet and discussed\nkey research directions in quantum network design, illustrating\nthe shift required from classical network paradigms to ac-\ncommodate quantum-specific phenomena, i.e., entanglement\nand quantum teleportation. The study in [13] investigated\nthe integration of quantum computing, FL, and 6G networks\nand their role in enhancing IoT privacy and security. It also\nsheds light on the recent advancements in this field, while\noffering a design of a conceptual framework and outlining\nfuture implications for the field. However, authors have limited\ndiscussion on the applications of QFL in IoT systems. An\noverview of the journey from FL to QFL was discussed\nin [6], providing basic concepts related to this transition.\nAuthors highlighted integration strategies, current challenges,\nand future directions in leveraging quantum computing to en-\nhance ML computational efficiency and security, overlooking\nseveral other aspects of QFL in their discussion. Similarly,\nthe discussion in [14] was confined to QFL’s key components,\nchallenges, and solutions for deployment over classical and\nquantum networks. This work provided only a brief overview\nwithout delving into the holistic technical fundamentals as\nwell as applications of QFL. Another work [15] proposed a\nquantum-empowered FL framework for space-air-ground in-\ntegrated networks, employing variational quantum algorithms\nand quantum relays to enhance model training and secure\nlong-distance model transmission. Nevertheless, this paper\nlimited its discussion to the application of QFL within aerial\nnetworks only. The study in [16] presented a comprehensive\nsurvey of FL applications within IoT networks, exploring how\nFL integrates and enhances various services. The studies in\n[17], [18] conducted a review of FL systems, analyzing key\nsystem components and presenting design factors and studies.\nThe authors compared different ML deployment architectures,\noffering a new classification of FL research, and discussing\ncomprehensive taxonomies, challenges, and future directions\nin the field. Nonetheless, they did not explore the integration\nof quantum mechanics into the distributed ML environment.\nIn addition to these works, other recent surveys have also\nexplored the QFL landscape. Ballester et al. [19] provide\na comprehensive literature review covering the foundations,\nchallenges, and future directions of QFL, while Saha et al.\n[20] offer a concise overview of the progress and opportunities\npresented at a recent conference. These papers make valu-\nable contributions to consolidating knowledge in this rapidly\nevolving field. Our survey builds upon and complements\nthese efforts by providing several distinct contributions: 1)\na more granular, multi-layered taxonomy that systematically\nclassifies QFL architectures, communication schemes, and\nsecurity mechanisms; 2) a unique focus on industry devel-\nopments and commercialization prospects, bridging the gap\nbetween academic research and market potential; and 3) a\npractical case study that offers a tangible demonstration of\nQFL implementation using current tools. By integrating these\ntheoretical, practical, and industry-focused perspectives, our\nwork provides a holistic, end-to-end resource for the research\ncommunity.\nWhile the recent field of QFL has received significant atten-\ntion, existing surveys have primarily focused on its quantum-\ncentric aspects, including novel circuit designs, quantum-\nenhanced security protocols, and theoretical performance\ngains. However, a critical gap remains in contextualizing QFL\nwithin the broader landscape of practical FL challenges. Foun-\ndational issues that govern the performance and feasibility\nof classical FL systems are often overlooked, yet they will\nundoubtedly persist and evolve in the quantum paradigm. Two\nsuch pivotal challenges are the management of FL processing\non resource-constrained edge devices and the strategic selec-\ntion of clients for training rounds [19]. Efficiently orchestrating\nmodel training at the edge requires sophisticated resource\nmanagement to handle the trade-offs between communica-\ntion, computation, and energy, as thoroughly surveyed in\nworks like [21]. Similarly, client selection has evolved into\na complex task where modern strategies must balance model\nconvergence speed with system fairness and data heterogeneity\n[22]. Neglecting these operational realities can render even\nthe most advanced QFL algorithms impractical for real-world\ndeployment.\nTo bridge this gap and provide a more holistic perspective,\nour survey makes a distinct contribution by integrating the\nprinciples of QFL with a grounded discussion of these persis-\ntent operational challenges. Unlike prior works that treat QFL\nin a theoretical aspect, we explicitly address how the unique\nconstraints of edge computing will influence the design and\ndeployment of future QFL networks.\nAlthough FL has been extensively explored in existing\nliterature, and works have addressed various facets of QFL,\nno study to date offers a comprehensive review of QFL that\nincludes its fundamental principles, taxonomy, applications,\ncase studies, as well as market opportunities. Motivated by\nthese limitations, we conduct a comprehensive review of\nQFL. Particularly, we provide a state-of-the-art survey of\nQFL, starting from the fundamental knowledge behind this\nintegration and extending our investigation to its applications\nin diverse fields. We explore the taxonomy of QFL along\nthe way, from networking, communication, optimization, and\nsecurity perspectives. We also present a case study of QFL,\nalong with challenges and future research directions in this\nemerging yet promising field. Key insights and lessons learned\nare also presented. The key contributions of this work are\nhighlighted as follows:\n• We present a state-of-the-art survey on QFL, starting\nwith the basics of quantum computing and progressively\nexpanding our exploration to include recent advance-\nments in QFL, as well as a discussion on the vision and\nprospects that have driven its development.\n• We discuss the industry and commercialization oppor-\ntunities of QFL and their potential impact on future\ntechnological landscapes.\n• We illustrate how QFL solves the constraints of tradi-\ntional FL in terms of scalability, accuracy, and security,\nthereby offering a thorough study of the requirement of\nintegrating quantum computing with FL. This comparison\nhelps researchers move more successfully from FL to\nQFL-based solutions.\n• We meticulously explore the taxonomy of QFL, detailing\ndiverse federation architectures, networking topologies,\ncommunication schemes, optimization strategies, and se-\ncurity mechanisms to provide a foundational understand-\ning of the advancements in QFL.\n• We perform a holistic investigation and analysis of the\npotential application of QFL across various domains,\nsuch as vehicular networks, healthcare systems, satellite\nnetworks, the metaverse, and network security.\n• We present a case study that demonstrates the practical\napplication and effectiveness of QFL using current frame-\nworks, platforms, and prototype applications.\n• The key lessons learned are highlighted at the end of each\nsection. Lastly, we identify a couple of important research\nchallenges and then discuss possible directions for future\nresearch in the field of QFL.\nB.

BACKGROUND KNOWLEDGE, INDUSTRY\nDEVELOPMENTS AND COMMERCIALIZATION\nThis section presents a few foundational concepts related\nto quantum qubits, quantum gates, quantum layers, quan-\ntum measurements, and quantum model communications in a\nquantum network, which are essential in QFL design. Market\nopportunities of quantum computing and FL/ML are also\ndiscussed.\nA. Background Knowledge\n1) Quantum Bits: One of the fundamental units of quantum\ncomputing is quantum-bits which is also known as qubits. In\ntraditional devices, a bit can either be in one of two states: 0 or\n1. However, qubits can exist in a superposition state, meaning\nit can represent 0 and 1 simultaneously. In a Hilbert space,\nwhich is a two-dimensional complex vector space represented\nas H ⊆C2, where C is the complex number field, while\nC2 is the space of 2D complex vectors. The fundamental\ncomputational basis states are represented as\n|0⟩= [1 0]T , |1⟩= [0 1]T ,\n(1)\nand these states are a complete and orthogonal set of H where\northogonality means ⟨0|1⟩= 0 and ⟨0|0⟩= ⟨1|1⟩= 1. The\nsuperposition allows qubits to represent more than one state.\nA qubit state is expressed as\n|ψ⟩= [α β]T = α|0⟩+ β|1⟩∈H,\n(2)\nIEEE COMMUNICATIONS SURVEYS & TUTORIALS\nTable II: A Structured Comparison of Our Survey with Existing Literature Based on Key Coverage Areas.\nRef.\nPrimary Focus\nKey\nContribu-\ntions\nLimitations\nPrinciples\nTaxonomy\nApps\nCase Studies\nMarket\n[9]\nQFL Concepts\nChallenges,\nopportunities,\nengineering\nperspective.\nLimited scope on\nbasics, network-\ning, and applica-\ntions.\n◦\n✓\n◦\n✗\n✗\n[19]\nQFL\nLiterature\nReview\nFoundations,\nchallenges,\nfuture directions.\nLacks deep tax-\nonomy and im-\nplementation de-\ntails.\n✓\n◦\n✓\n✗\n✗\n[20]\nQFL Progress\nConference\noverview\nof\nprogress,\nchallenges.\nHigh-level;\nnot\nan\nin-depth\nsurvey.\n◦\n✗\n◦\n✗\n✗\n[3]\nQuantum\nInternet\nQuantum\nnetwork\ndesign,\nentanglement.\nLacks\ncomprehensive\nQFL\nprinciples\nand applications.\n◦\n✗\n◦\n✗\n✗\n[6]\nFL to QFL Tran-\nsition\nIntegration\nstrategies,\nchallenges,\nefficiency.\nOverlooks broad\ndiscussion of ap-\nplications.\n✓\n◦\n✗\n✗\n✗\n[14]\nQFL\nComponents\nKey components,\ndeployment chal-\nlenges.\nBrief\noverview;\nlacks\ndeep\ntechnical\nfundamentals.\n◦\n✓\n◦\n✗\n✗\n[13]\nQFL in 6G/IoT\nIntegration\nwith\n6G/IoT, privacy,\nsecurity.\nLimited\ndiscussion\non broader QFL\napplications.\n◦\n◦\n✓\n✗\n✗\n[15]\nQFL\nin\nAerial\nNets\nSpace-air-ground\nnetworks, VQAs.\nScope limited to\nthe single appli-\ncation of aerial\nnetworks.\n◦\n✗\n✓\n✗\n✗\n[16]\nClassical FL in\nIoT\nFL\napplications\nin\nIoT,\nchallenges.\nDoes\nnot\nexplore quantum\ncomputing\nintegration.\n✗\n✓\n✓\n◦\n✗\n[17]\nClassical FL Sys-\ntems\nSystem\ncomponents,\ndesign\nfactors,\ncase studies.\nDoes not delve\ninto\nquantum\nmechanics\nintegration.\n✗\n✓\n◦\n✓\n✗\n[18]\nClassical\nFL\nArchs.\nML\ndeployment\narchitectures, FL\nclassification.\nOverlooks\nquantum\nmechanics\nintegration.\n✗\n✓\n✗\n◦\n✗\nOur work\nComprehensive\nQFL Survey\nEnd-to-\nend\nsurvey,\nprinciples,\ntaxonomy,\napplications,\ncase\nstudy,\nmarket analysis.\nN/A\n✓\n✓\n✓\n✓\n✓\n✓: Covered; ◦: Partially covered; ✗: Not covered.\nwhere |ψ⟩is known as ket psi and α and β are two complex\nnumbers that must satisfy\n|α|2+|β|2= 1.\n(3)\nAgain, the conjugate transpose of |ψ⟩is ⟨ψ| which is known\nas bra psi [14] can be written as\n⟨ψ|= |ψ⟩† = [α∗β∗] = α∗⟨0|+β∗⟨1|.\n(4)\nFor two states |ψ1⟩and |ψ2⟩, the inner product between two\nstates is\n⟨ψ1|ψ2⟩= α∗\n1α2 + β∗\n1β2,\n(5)\nand the outer product is\n|ψ1⟩⟨ψ2|=\n\u0014α∗\n1α2\nα∗\n1β2\nβ∗\n1α2\nβ∗\n1β2\n\u0015\n.\n(6)\nSection I.

A Case Study\nFig. 1: Organization of this survey paper.\nFor a system with Dq qubits, the total state space is the\ntensor product of the individual qubit spaces:\nH =\nD−1\nO\nd=0\nHd = (C2)\nN Dq.\n(7)\nIn other words, given we have Dq qubits, we can combine\nthe individual spaces Hd into one larger space [23]. A qubit\ncan be represented using a Bloch sphere, as shown in Fig. 3.\n2) Quantum Gates: A quantum gate is defined by a unitary\nmatrix U fulfilling U †U = I where U † is the conjugate trans-\npose of U and I represents the identity matrix. This matrix\nconverts qubit states in Hilbert space H, and U transforms\nthe states. The most common gates used in quantum are Pauli\ngates, and a single-qubit Pauli gate can be written as\nX =\n\u00120\n1\n1\n0\n\u0013\n,\nY =\n\u00120\n−i\ni\n0\n\u0013\n,\nZ =\n\u00121\n0\n0\n−1\n\u0013\n.\nRotations with an angle w around the x, y, and z axes are\ngiven as\nRx(w) = e−i w\n2 X =\n\u0012\ncos w\n2\n−i sin w\n2\n−i sin w\n2\ncos w\n2\n\u0013\n,\n(8)\nGlobal\naggregation\nLocal\nQNN\nLocal\nQNN\nDevice 1\nDevice N\nServer\nTrain angle\nLocal\nQNN\nTraining\n𝑅𝑥\nZ\nZ\n|0⟩\n…\nState\n𝑈(ω𝑛)\nMeasurement\nQNN\n…\nQuantum SGD update\nω𝑛𝑡+1 = ω𝑛𝑡−η𝑡∇f𝑛(ω𝑛)|ω𝑛=ω𝑛𝑡\nω1\n𝑡\nω𝑁\n𝑡\n…\n ω𝑘+1 =  \n𝑛=1\n𝑁\nω𝑛,𝑘\n𝑇\n|Ψ𝑛(ω𝑛)⟩=𝑈(ω𝑛)|0⟩\nPQC\nencoder\n𝑅𝑦\n𝑅𝑥\n𝑅𝑦\n𝑅𝑥\n𝑅𝑦\n𝑅𝑥\n𝑅𝑦\n𝑅𝑧\n𝑅𝑧\n|0⟩\nFig. 2: QFL framework where distributed quantum devices\ncollaborate with a central server to train a shared ML model.\nEach device converts practical data into quantum form utilizing\na state encoder, processes this data through a PQC with\nadjustable angle parameters, and uses the results from mea-\nsurements to update local model parameters. These updated\nmodels are then sent to the server for aggregation.\nRy(w) = e−i w\n2 Y =\n\u0012cos w\n2\n−sin w\n2\nsin w\n2\ncos w\n2\n\u0013\n,\n(9)\nRz(w) = e−i w\n2 Z =\n\u0012e−i w\n2\n0\n0\nei w\n2\n\u0013\n.\n(10)\nThe Hadamard gate is another significant single-qubit gate\nwidely used in QFL. It is expressed as\nH =\n1\n√\n2\n\u00141\n1\n1\n−1\n\u0015\n.\n(11)\nTwo-qubit operations can be handled as “controlled” gates.\nControlled-X (CNOT) and controlled-Z gates defined as\nCX,1,2 =\n\u0014\nI\n0\n0\nX\n\u0015\n,\n(12)\nCZ,1,2 =\n\u0014\nI\n0\n0\nZ\n\u0015\n,\n(13)\nwith 0 being a square zero matrix and I being the identity\nmatrix.

If we want to combine the two spaces, the total\nspace is HA ⊗HB.\nIf the systems has interdependent states, for example |ψ⟩A\nand |ψ⟩B, it is called separable or unentanglement where we\ncan simply join them as\n|ψ⟩= |ψ⟩A ⊗|ψ⟩B.\n(16)\nHowever, not all states in HA and HB have independent\nstates. A general two-qubit states can be written as\n|ψ⟩=\nX\na,b∈{0,1}\ncab|a⟩A ⊗|b⟩B.\n(17)\nWe call the state entangled if we can not factor cab into a\nproduct of ca and cb, consequently making |ψ⟩inseparable.\nFor example,Bell state (Ω) is an entangled state that forms a\ncomplete basis\nΩ= {|Φ+⟩AB, |Φ−⟩AB, |Ψ+⟩AB, |Ψ−⟩AB}.\n(18)\nThese are defined as\n|Φ+⟩AB =\n1\n√\n2(|0⟩A ⊗|0⟩B + |1⟩A ⊗|1⟩B),\n(19a)\n|Φ−⟩AB =\n1\n√\n2(|0⟩A ⊗|0⟩B −|1⟩A ⊗|1⟩B),\n(19b)\n|Ψ+⟩AB =\n1\n√\n2(|0⟩A ⊗|1⟩B + |1⟩A ⊗|0⟩B),\n(19c)\n|Ψ−⟩AB =\n1\n√\n2(|0⟩A ⊗|1⟩B −|1⟩A ⊗|0⟩B).\n(19d)\nThe systems A and B are so closely connected in these states\nthat it is impossible to classify each one as an independent\nstate.\nFig. 3: A Bloch sphere of a qubit where any point on the\nsurface corresponds to a valid pure quantum state—a range\nof possibilities unavailable to classical bits. For instance, the\nstate |0⟩+|1⟩\n√\n2\nlies at the equator on the positive x-axis.\nTutorial Box I: Foundational Quantum Concepts\nTo grasp the innovations of QFL, a few core quan-\ntum concepts are essential. Here are some simplified,\nanalogy-based explanations for a generalist audience.\n• Qubit: A classical bit is like a light switch: it is\ndefinitively either OFF (0) or ON (1). A qubit,\nhowever, is like a dimmer switch. It can exist in\na state of superposition, representing a value that is\nsome combination of 0 and 1 simultaneously. This\nability to hold more information is a fundamental\nsource of quantum computing’s power.\n• Superposition: This is the state of the ”dimmer\nswitch” before you look at it. The qubit exists in a\nrich spectrum of possibilities. However, the moment\nyou measure it, the superposition ”collapses,” and\nthe qubit is forced to choose a classical state—either\n0 or 1. The art of quantum algorithms is to ma-\nnipulate these superpositions to make the desired\noutcome the most probable upon measurement.\n• Entanglement: Often called ”spooky action at a dis-\ntance,” this is a unique quantum connection between\ntwo or more qubits.\n• Quantum Gate: A classical logic gate (like AND or\nNOT) flips bits. A quantum gate is an operation that\nmanipulates the state of a qubit. It can be visualized\nas rotating the state of the qubit on a sphere (the\nBloch sphere). These precise rotations allow for far\nmore complex information processing than simple\nbit-flips.\n4) Quantum Measurements: In quantum physics, a mea-\nsurement is described using an observable, which is a specific\ntype of operator called a Hermitian operator. A Hermitian\noperator O is defined as O = O†, where O† represents\nits conjugate transpose. In projective measurements, these\noperators are also unitary, fulfilling O†O = I. The observable\nmay be expressed using spectral decomposition in terms of its\neigenvalues and eigenvectors\nO =\nM−1\nX\nm=0\nλmPm,\n(20)\nwhere λm are the measurement outcomes (eigenvalues), and\nPm are the projectors that correspond to those results. Each\nPm projects the quantum state onto a subspace (eigenspace)\nassociated with λm. When measuring a quantum state |ψ⟩, the\nprobability of obtaining a result m is\np(m) = ⟨ψ|Pm|ψ⟩= ⟨Pm⟩ψ.\n(21)\nFollowing this measurement, the state collapses (changes)\nto Pm|ψ⟩, with probability p(m). The expected value (average\nacross several measurements) of the observable in state |ψ⟩is\nEψ[O] =\nM−1\nX\nm=0\nλmp(m) = ⟨O⟩ψ.\n(22)\nObservables {O1, . . . , OK} are considered commuting if\nthey can be measured jointly and have similar eigenvectors.\nThis implies that for all i, j, the commutator is zero\n[Oi, Oj] = OiOj −OjOi = 0.\n(23)\nThese observables, known as pairwise commuting, can be\ndetected concurrently inside the same quantum system.\nThe choice of measuring foundation greatly determines the\nexact result of a quantum measurement. Different measuring\nbases (e.g., computational or Hadamard bases) project quan-\ntum states onto particular outcomes depending on different\nprobability distributions. Therefore, the proper choice of mea-\nsurement basis is essential to recover valuable information\ncontained in quantum circuits [24].\nIn quantum machine learning models, such as those applied\nin QFL, the measurement step usually reflects the last stage\nof quantum computations, so converting the quantum process-\ning outputs into classical data usable by the next classical\nanalysis and decision-making stages. Quantum measurement\nis still fundamentally probabilistic, which creates statistical\nuncertainty and noise problems, particularly with restricted\nmeasurements (shots) availability. Research in this crucial area\nis still much needed to overcome these obstacles by means\nof improved measurement methodologies and error reduction\nstrategies, hence improving dependability and performance in\nQFL systems [25].\n5) Quantum Model Communications: Essential in QFL, the\nQuantum Model Communication is the transfer of trained\nQML model parameters from distributed quantum devices to a\ncentral quantum server for aggregation. Following local model\ntraining with either quantum or hybrid quantum-classical\nalgorithms, devices create model updates either in classical\nor quantum form, each necessitating different communication\nmechanisms [26].\nStandard wireless communication systems can effectively\ntransport this data if the learned model parameters are clas-\nsical, for example, numerical values generated by monitoring\nquantum states. Reliably enabling such transmissions is con-\nventional communication channels such as Wi-Fi, other classi-\ncal networks, mobile networks (5G and eventual 6G). Ensuring\nlow latency and broad compatibility, these established, highly\nscalable, adequately resilient techniques are fit for classical\nparameter distribution [27].\nConversely, conventional communication systems are inad-\nequate when model parameters are encoded as quantum states.\nQuantum states call for specific quantum communication sys-\ntems that maintain quantum coherence, such as QKD channels\nbuilt using optical fiber cables or FSO networks. Through\nquantum entanglement and superposition, these quantum chan-\nnels enable safe transmission, therefore providing intrinsically\nbetter security assurances against eavesdropping and inter-\nception than conventional techniques. Practical problems for\nquantum communication, however, include limited transmis-\nsion rates, quantum state decoherence over long distances,\nand infrastructure complexity. To improve dependability and\nscalability in quantum model communications inside the QFL\nframeworks, addressing these problems calls for continuous\ndevelopments in quantum repeaters, entanglement distribution\ntechniques, and quantum networking technology [27].\nB. Industry Developments and Commercialization\nQuantum computing, leveraging principles of quantum me-\nchanics, promises exponential advancements in computational\ncapabilities. With a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of\n34.8%, Fortune Business Insights estimates that the worldwide\nquantum computing industry was valued at USD 885.4 million\nin 2023 and is expected to rise from USD 1,160.1 million in\n2024 to USD 12,620.7 million by 2032 [28]. The possibility of\ntechnology to transform sectors, including finance, healthcare,\nand logistics, by improved data processing and problem-\nsolving capacity, drives this development [29].\nEmphasizing even more the financial impact, a Boston\nConsulting Group analysis projects that by 2040, quantum\ncomputing might generate 450 billion to 850 billion in eco-\nnomic value worldwide, therefore supporting a 90 billion\nto 170 billion market for hardware and software providers.\nThis estimate emphasizes the expected major investments and\ndevelopments in the field of quantum computing [30].\nA subset of artificial intelligence, machine learning has\nevolved into a necessary tool for many different fields, foster-\ning creativity and efficiency all around. Emerging in ML, FL\nallows cooperative model training across distributed devices\nwhile maintaining data privacy—a major issue in the data-\ndriven environment of today [31].\nGlobally, FL is showing rather explosive expansion. Grand\nView Research projects the market size to be USD 119.4\nmillion in 2022 and to rise at a CAGR of 12.7% from 2023\nto 2030 [32]. Constant developments in ML methods and\nthe growing focus on data privacy and security drive this\nIEEE COMMUNICATIONS SURVEYS & TUTORIALS\nexpansion, offering a quite different viewpoint, projecting, at\na CAGR of 10.6% over the projected period, the FL market\nsize from USD 127 million in 2023 to USD 210 million.\nThough forecasts vary, the increasing trend shows a strong\nmarket potential for FL systems [28], [33]. There is great\npromise at the junction of FL and quantum computers. Aiming\nto maximize the computational capability of quantum com-\nputing while preserving its distributed and privacy-protecting\nfeatures, QFL, integrating quantum technologies with FL,\nwould provide hitherto unheard-of data analysis and decision-\nmaking capacity as it develops. Despite a general decline in\nIT spending, venture capital financing in quantum computing\nis rising to $1.2 billion in 2023. This financial dedication\nunderscores the rising hope in quantum technologies’ ability\nto create a major economic impact [34].\nIII. QFL: THE INTEGRATION OF QUANTUM COMPUTING\nAND FEDERATED LEARNING\nA. Motivation of QC and FL Integration\nTo highlight the motivation behind integrating QC and FL,\nit is important to consider the unique strengths and properties\nof each technology and how their combination can create a\npowerful new paradigm.\nOn one side, QC offers exceptional computational capa-\nbilities that go far beyond what is possible with classical\nalgorithms. By leveraging quantum principles such as su-\nperposition and entanglement, QC enables novel algorithms\ncapable of solving complex problems intractable for classical\nsystems [35]. For example, in QML algorithms such as the\nVQE have shown the potential to outperform classical machine\nlearning models, especially in areas such as optimization and\nsimulation.\n• Solving High-Dimensional Optimization Problems Effi-\nciently: Classical FL systems often struggle with complex\noptimization tasks, especially when dealing with large-\nscale, non-convex loss surfaces typical in deep learning.\nQC introduces quantum optimization algorithms, such\nas the VQE and Quantum Approximate Optimization\nAlgorithm (QAOA), which leverage quantum parallelism\nto explore vast solution spaces more efficiently. These\nquantum methods can potentially find better minima in\nhigh-dimensional landscapes faster than classical optimiz-\ners, leading to improved convergence and accuracy in FL\ntasks [36].\n•\nProcessing Quantum Data and Modeling Quantum-\nInfluenced Systems: Classical FL cannot handle inher-\nently quantum data or systems influenced by quantum\nmechanics, such as in quantum chemistry, materials sci-\nence, or quantum sensor networks. QC is naturally suited\nto represent and manipulate quantum states, enabling the\ntraining of QML models directly on quantum information\n[37]. When integrated into FL systems, QC expands the\napplicability of FL to quantum-domain tasks that are\nbeyond the reach of classical data representations or\nmodels.\n• Reducing Communication Bottlenecks via Quantum En-\ncoding and Compression: One of the main limitations\nin classical FL is communication overhead due to fre-\nquent transmission of large model updates. QC offers\nnovel quantum communication techniques, such as quan-\ntum teleportation and entanglement-assisted compression,\nwhich can drastically reduce the volume of information\nshared across nodes [38]. These techniques enable more\nefficient aggregation of quantum model updates in dis-\ntributed settings, improving scalability and responsive-\nness in large-scale federated networks.\nOn the other hand, FL provides a decentralized approach\nto training machine learning models while preserving data\nprivacy. Instead of aggregating raw data in a central location,\nFL allows data to remain local, with only model updates\nshared among participants. This approach enhances privacy,\nreduces communication costs, and enables learning across\ndistributed and siloed data sources. As a result, FL has become\nespecially valuable in privacy-sensitive quantum application\ndomains such as IoTs and wireless networks [39].\n• Preserving Data Privacy in Quantum-Enhanced Applica-\ntions: QML models that collect and aggregate quantum\nor classical data into a central processor or server pose\nprivacy and security risks, particularly in sensitive fields\nlike healthcare, finance, and personal devices [7]. FL\nkeeps quantum-enhanced data confined to quantum nodes\nor organizations. FL ensures data privacy while facil-\nitating collaborative learning by exchanging encrypted\nor abstracted model changes rather than raw data. In\nquantum-enabled systems, this is essential for user trust\nand HIPAA and GDPR compliance.\n• Enabling Scalable and Collaborative Quantum Learning\nAcross Distributed Devices: As QC evolves, the vision\nof interconnected, modular quantum processors becomes\nmore feasible. FL supports this model by enabling de-\ncentralized learning across multiple quantum nodes, each\noperating with limited qubits and computational power.\nUnlike centralized QML, which depends on a single\nlarge-scale quantum device, FL allows many smaller,\ngeographically dispersed quantum systems to collabora-\ntively train a global model. This decentralization aligns\nperfectly with the distributed architecture of quantum\nnetworks and helps overcome current NISQ-era hardware\nconstraints [40].\n• Reducing Communication and Resource Bottlenecks in\nQuantum Networks: Centralized QML often faces scal-\nability challenges due to the need to transmit large\nvolumes of quantum data or intermediate states to a\ncentral processor, which is impractical over current quan-\ntum communication infrastructure [41]. FL mitigates this\nissue by minimizing communication requirements: only\nquantum model updates or compressed parameters need\nto be shared among participants. This not only reduces\ncommunication overhead but also preserves bandwidth\nand hardware resources, making intelligent quantum sys-\ntems more efficient and practical to deploy across edge\nquantum devices or hybrid quantum-classical platforms.\nAfter evaluating the field’s substantial state-of-the-art re-\nsearch, merging QC and FL is motivated by their compli-\nmentary strengths and limits. QC addresses computational\nintensity and scalability issues in FL, whereas FL provides\nprivacy-preserving and decentralized framework for practical\nimplementation in distributed quantum settings [42]. It consti-\ntute QFL, a promising new paradigm that incorporates both\ntechnologies’ capabilities.\nQC and FL integration in QFL provides a solution to\ndifficulties in both domains, creating new prospects for safe,\nintelligent quantum learning systems [43]. QFL might power\na wide range of real-world applications and shape quantum-\ndriven technologies by accelerating scientific discovery and\nimproving data privacy in quantum-enabled infrastructures.\nB. QFL Working Concept\nIn this section, we present the architecture and fundamental\noperation of QFL, as illustrated in Fig. 2. QFL represents a\nnovel paradigm that integrates QC with FL principles, allowing\nmultiple quantum-enabled devices to collaboratively train a\nshared machine learning model without exchanging raw data\n[44]. This decentralized approach not only enhances data\nprivacy but also leverages the computational advantages of\nquantum devices in distributed environments. The overall QFL\nprocess is coordinated by a central server, which manages\ncommunication, aggregation, and synchronization between\nquantum devices [45], [46]. A typical QFL algorithm follows\na cyclical, multi-step process composed of the following key\nstages:\n• Step 1 – Quantum Data Encoding: Each device begins\nby encoding its private classical dataset into quantum\nstates. This is performed using a quantum state en-\ncoder, which maps classical feature vectors into quantum\nHilbert space representations [47]. The encoding process\ngenerally starts with state preparation, where qubits are\ninitialized in their ground state, |0⟩. Various encoding\ntechniques—such as angle encoding, amplitude encoding,\nor basis encoding—may be employed depending on the\nnature of the data and the desired learning task. This step\nensures that the data is represented in a form compatible\nwith quantum processing and suitable for input into PQCs\n[48].\n• Step 2 – Local Training with PQCs: Once the data is\nencoded, it is passed through a PQC at each device.\nThe PQC consists of a series of quantum gates whose\nbehavior is controlled by trainable parameters (analogous\nto weights in classical neural networks) [49]. These\ngates manipulate the qubits and entangle them to explore\ncomplex quantum correlations within the input data. After\napplying the PQC, the qubits are measured, and the result-\ning classical outputs (e.g., measurement probabilities or\nexpectation values) are used to compute the loss function.\nUsing gradient-based optimization techniques such as\nStochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), the device updates\nits local PQC parameters based on the loss, effectively\ntraining the quantum model on local data [50].\n• Step 3 – Model Sharing and Aggregation: Every quantum\ndevice provides its updated PQC parameters or gradients\nto a central server [51] following local training. Usually,\napplying techniques such as FedAvg, the server gener-\nates an updated global model by means of a safe and\nprivacy-preserving aggregate. After that, this model is\nsent back to every involved quantum device to synchro-\nnize their local PQC settings. One worldwide cycle is\ncompleted here; the procedure is continued over several\nrounds until the model converges or achieves acceptable\nperformance. Although this procedure is comparable to\nclassical FL, QFL adds special factors including quantum\nencoding, circuit depth restrictions, and quantum-specific\nnoise management. These variations make QFL more\nappropriate for quantum data processing and privacy-\nsensitive uses in quantum-enabled environments. This\ndifference clarifies for researchers familiar with classical\nFL the motivation and required modifications for working\nin QFL environments [52].\nThroughout the QFL process, no raw data ever leaves the\nlocal device environments, ensuring strong data privacy and\ncompliance with regulatory requirements. Moreover, the use\nof quantum circuits in the training process introduces potential\ncomputational advantages, especially for learning tasks involv-\ning high-dimensional data or complex feature interactions.\nIV. FUNDAMENTALS OF QFL AND TAXONOMY\nHaving established the motivation for integrating quantum\ncomputing with federated learning, this section delves into\nthe core components that constitute a QFL system. For a\ncommunications generalist, this section provides a framework\nfor building a QFL network. We present a holistic discus-\nsion on the fundamentals (Fig.\n4), including Federation\nArchitecture, Networking Topology, Communication Schemes,\nOptimization in QFL, and Security Mechanisms in QFL. We\nalso provide a taxonomy summarized in Table\nIV, giving\nvaluable insights into these design aspects of the QFL system.\nA. Federation Architecture\n1) Fully QFL: In Fully Quantum Federated Learning (Fully\nQFL), numerous dispersed devices with fully quantum models\ncooperate safely and effectively to train a global quantum\nmodel without explicitly communicating sensitive local quan-\ntum data. A common example is when all devices use VQE\nwith PQCs, enabling improved computations and optimization\nat local quantum nodes [53].\nThis design uses a hybrid quantum-classical technique to\ntrain a local quantum model on each device, namely a PQC\nwith classically optimal parameters to lower a preset quantum\nloss function. PQCs, typically quantum gates with changeable\nclassical parameters, enable quantum hardware to learn and\nembed complex patterns in quantum states [54]. Customers se-\ncurely upload quantum model updates or measurement results\nto a quantum-enabled server after local training. This server\ncreates a global quantum model from quantum updates using\nproperly prepared quantum aggregation or quantum averaging\nand sends updated parameters to devices. This method utilizes\nquantum entanglement, superposition, and interference to code\nIEEE COMMUNICATIONS SURVEYS & TUTORIALS\nFederation \nArchitecture\nHybrid QFL\nNetwork Topology\nCentralized \nQFL\nHierarchical \nQFL\nDecentralized \nQFL\nCommunication \nSchemes\nClassical \nCommunication\nQuantum \nCommunication\nOptimizations for \nQFL\nModel \nOptimization\nCommunication \nOptimization\nSecurity Mechanisms \nin QFL\nQuantum Key \nDistribution\nQuantum \nHomomorphic \nEncryption\nQuantum \nDifferential \nPrivacy\nBlind \nQuantum \nComputing\nFully QFL\nFig. 4: QFL fundamentals explored in this paper.\nand analyze data more efficiently than traditional federated\nmethods [55].\nQuantum features prevent undesired inference of device data\nfrom aggregated quantum states, making fully QFL designs\nmore secure and private. Adversarial attacks, unauthorized\ndata breaches, and FL system faults are reduced by this\narchitecture. Recent research suggests that fully quantum\nfederated architectures can transform privacy-preserving dis-\ntributed quantum machine learning, leading to widespread\nadoption in decentralized scenarios [56], despite challenges\nsuch as quantum noise, hardware constraints, and maintaining\nquantum coherence.\n2) Hybrid QFL: Combining classical NN layers with quan-\ntum layers, the Hybrid QFL architecture essentially merges\nclassical machine learning capabilities with quantum-enhanced\ncomputations to use the benefits of both paradigms [57].\nUsually consisting of convolutional or fully connected layers\nthat effectively handle large-dimensional data and the lower\ncomputational overhead before quantum processing, initial\ndata processing and feature extraction usually occur in such\nhybrid architectures via classical NN layers. Extracted clas-\nsical features are then encoded into quantum states and run\nthrough PQCs, therefore allowing complicated pattern recog-\nnition, enhanced feature mapping, and optimization powers\ngiven by quantum mechanics [58].\nA typical hybrid QFL design consists of two initial con-\nventional NN layers that are used for feature extraction and\ndimensionality reduction. Subsequently, quantum layers are\nemployed to encode and learn high-level features using quan-\ntum gates and variational quantum circuits. These quantum\nlayers consist of quantum circuits parameterized by trainable\nclassical parameters, refined using hybrid quantum-classical\ntraining methods like VQAs. By means of classical optimiza-\ntion approaches, VQAs enable quantum circuits to iteratively\nlearn optimal parameters, hence greatly enhancing learning\nperformance over classical-only models in several challenging\ntasks [59].\nMultiple distributed devices independently learn their local\nhybrid quantum-classical models on local datasets in hybrid\nQFL. Usually, by averaging classical parameters, the devices\nthen safely send classical parameters of quantum layers or\nmeasurement results to a centralized aggregator, which accu-\nmulates the updates. Aggregated parameters are then provided\nto all devices, therefore improving global model performance\ncooperatively without specifically disclosing sensitive data\n[60]. By using quantum properties—such as quantum uncer-\ntainty and entanglement—to further safeguard data privacy,\nhence greatly lowering the risks connected with adversarial\nattacks, privacy breaches, or illegal data inference, hybrid QFL\ndesigns offer excellent security guarantees.\nB. Networking Topology\n1) Centralized QFL: In Centralized QFL, a central quan-\ntum server organizes communications and model aggregation\nacross several distributed quantum devices using a hub-and-\nspoke model of the networking topology. During the FL pro-\ncess, the networking topology guarantees scalability and man-\nageability across quantum nodes by allowing organized coor-\ndination and effective parameter synchronizing [6]. Equipped\nwith either local quantum models or hybrid quantum-classical\nmodels, every device trains on its private data and sends\nencrypted updates, such as quantum measurement results or\nPQC parameters, to the central aggregator. The central server\nthen distributes the revised global model back to all devices\nby combining these changes with quantum-aware aggregation\nmethods.\nAmong the various benefits of the centralized topology in\nQFL are simplified communication protocols, reduced system\ncomplexity, and better control over synchronizing and training\nconvergence. To guarantee safe communication and guard\nagainst eavesdropping or hostile interference [61], the central\nserver can also apply sophisticated quantum cryptography\ntechniques such as QKD or BQC. This design does, however,\nalso bring a possible single point of failure; therefore, the\ncentral server becomes an important target for quantum-level\nattacks or performance constraints.\nPractically, Centralized QFL utilizes quantum communi-\ncation channels, including quantum repeaters or entangled\nphoton networks, for the secure and efficient transmission\nof quantum information over extensive distances. Maintaining\ncoherence and integrity of quantum states during transmission\ndepends on these quantum communication systems, hence\nguaranteeing the dependability of FL systems [14]. Especially\nin settings where a resourceful central server can be trusted and\nmaintained, centralized QFL topologies remain a basic concept\nfor establishing secure and privacy-preserving quantum ma-\nchine learning systems at scale despite technical constraints.\n2) Hierarchical QFL: A multi-tiered networking design is\npresented in Hierarchical QFL to improve scalability, lower\nlatency, and control quantum resource distribution over dis-\npersed systems of vast scale as displayed in Fig. 5. Though\nhierarchical models have been extensively investigated in\nclassical FL, such as device-edge-cloud systems [62], these\nideas can be extended and adapted for quantum settings to\nenable more efficient quantum learning frameworks. Under\nthis design, quantum edge servers connect with a central\nquantum cloud server at the upper layer while quantum devices\nand quantum edge servers constitute the lower tier. While\nprotecting quantum data privacy, this tiered communication\nhierarchy enhances training efficiency and system scalability.\nWith PQC or VQA, every quantum device trains a local\nquantum or hybrid quantum-classical model. The relevant\nquantum edge server receives the locally trained parameters or\nmeasurement statistics from an intermediary aggregator. Like\nclassical edge nodes in hierarchical FL, these edge servers\ndo intra-cluster aggregation and then transfer the condensed\nmodel parameters to a central quantum cloud server. This\ntwo-stage aggregation lowers communication overhead by load\nbalancing among quantum resources.\nInspired by classical systems such as Hierarchical FL across\nHeterogeneous Cellular Networks [63] and Dynamic Resource\nAllocation in Decentralized Edge Intelligence [64], hierarchi-\ncal QFL could dynamically allocate quantum communication\nand computation resources between levels. It also allows\nfault-tolerant and adaptive learning, in which case quantum\nedge servers can replace local coordination without depending\njust on a central node. Maintaining fidelity over hierarchical\nlinks depends on quantum communication methods including\nentanglement switching or quantum repeaters.\n3) Decentralized QFL:\nIn Decentralized QFL, several\nquantum devices cooperatively train a shared global quantum\nmodel without depending on a central aggregator by use of a\nP2P network built as such. Inspired by classical decentralized\nFL systems, such as those described in the distributed edge\nintelligence frameworks, each quantum device independently\ntrains its quantum or hybrid quantum-classical model, usu-\nally using PQCs and VQA [65]. Following local training,\nevery device directly exchanges quantum model parameters or\nquantum measurement results with surrounding devices over\nsafe quantum communication channels, such as entanglement-\nassisted quantum networks or QKD links.\nDistributed QFL removes single points of failure, unlike\ncentralized topologies, therefore enhancing fault tolerance,\nscalability, and resistance against adversarial assaults. Using\ndistributed protocols such as quantum consensus algorithms,\nquantum-secured gossip protocols, or blockchain-inspired syn-\nchronizing mechanisms, quantum devices communicate fol-\nlowing distributed protocols, hence enabling collective con-\nvergence toward a global model. Because only encrypted\nor aggregated quantum model parameters are communicated\nand raw data stays localized, this distributed structure also\nimproves data privacy [66].\nEntanglement swapping and quantum teleportation, among\nother quantum communication methods, enable safe, direct\nquantum connections between nodes, hence enhancing security\nguarantees and preserving the quantum coherence required for\ndistributed quantum computations [67]. Decentralized QFL\nnaturally adapts to changing network topologies and device\nparticipation, hence, it is especially appropriate for quantum-\nenhanced edge computing environments, quantum IoT appli-\ncations, and scenarios with constrained infrastructure.\nWhen comparing these networking topologies, a clear trade-\noff emerges between simplicity, scalability, and robustness.\nThe Centralized approach is the most straightforward to\nimplement and manage but is inherently limited by the server’s\ncapacity and represents a single point of failure, making\nit preferable for smaller-scale or experimental QFL systems\nwhere control is paramount [68]. Hierarchical QFL offers\na more balanced solution, improving scalability and reduc-\ning communication bottlenecks, which is highly effective in\ncontexts like edge computing where a natural tiered structure\nexists [15]. However, it introduces additional complexity in\nmanaging intermediate aggregators. Decentralized QFL pro-\nvides the highest level of fault tolerance and privacy, making\nit theoretically ideal for large-scale, trustless environments [8].\nHowever, it can introduce significant communication over-\nhead due to increased peer-to-peer coordination. Therefore,\nits preference is limited by significant practical challenges in\nachieving network-wide consensus and synchronization, which\nremains an active area of research.\nC. Communication Schemes\n1) Classical Communications: A quantum-empowered FL\nsystem, especially intended for Space-Air-Ground Integrated\nNetworks (SAGIN), which are fundamental for the evolution\nof future 6G networks. It essentially manages the complexity\nof large datasets and model training over conventional commu-\nnications networks like 5G/6G by using variational quantum\nalgorithms for local training and quantum relays for safe\ndata delivery. All things considered, the architecture greatly\nimproves SAGIN security and efficiency of data processing,\nproviding a strong means of developing edge intelligence\napplications in the era of 6G technology [15].\nThe authors [69] present a new QFL framework for satellite-\nground communication using low Earth Orbit (LEO) satel-\nlite capability to improve world connectivity. Using Scalable\nQuantum Neural Networks (sQNN), which adapt to various\nconfigurations—angle and pole—the framework, called SQFL,\noptimizes both computing and communication workloads.\nMoreover, the efficiency of data transmission across con-\nventional communications networks such as 5G/6G is much\nIEEE COMMUNICATIONS SURVEYS & TUTORIALS\n∑\n∑\n∑\n∑\n∑\nParticipant 1\nParticipant 2\nParticipant 3\nParticipant N\nCentral Quantum \nCloud Server\nCENTRALIZED\nQUANTUM FEDERATED LEARNING\nGlobal\nUpdate\nModel\nUpdate\n∑\n∑\n∑\n∑\n∑\nParticipant 1\nParticipant 2\nParticipant 3\nParticipant N\nQuantum Cloud\nServer\nHIERARCHY\nQUANTUM FEDERATED LEARNING\nEdge\nServer\nEdge\nServer\nParticipant N\nParticipant 2\nParticipant 3\nParticipant 4\nSEMI - DECENTRALIZED\nQUANTUM FEDERATED LEARNING\n∑\nParticipant 1\nParameters\nExchange\nLeadership\nTransfer\n∑\n∑\nParticipant N\n∑\nParticipant 2\n∑\nParticipant 3\n∑\nParticipant 4\nDECENTRALIZED\nQUANTUM FEDERATED LEARNING\n∑\nParticipant 1\nParameters\nExchange\nLocal Dataset\nAggregation Algorithm\nQuantum Local Model\nQuantum Cloud Server\n∑\nFig. 5: Illustration of QFL Architectural Paradigms Based on Decentralization Levels: A Comparative Overview of Hierar-\nchical, Decentralized, Semi-Decentralized, and Centralized QFL Approaches Including Communication Schemes, Aggregation\nMethods, and Quantum Model Distribution\nimproved by including superposition coding and consecutive\ndecoding techniques. Under low signal-to-noise ratios and\nnon-IID data, especially, extensive experimental results show\nthat SQFL provides better performance in computational speed\nand communication efficiency than conventional FL methods\nin multi-LEO satellite scenarios and optimizing power alloca-\ntion for next-generation 6G networks.\nMoreover, artificial intelligence is discussed especially in\nthe development of 6G networks. Using FL and QFL, the work\nconcentrates on satisfying the requirements for computational\nefficiency and privacy in the heterogeneous and distributed\nSAGIN configuration. It underlines numerous uses where FL\nand QFL improve the functionality of SAGINs, including a\nthorough case study on QFL inside UAV networks, therefore\nproving its benefits over conventional FL techniques in terms\nof training efficiency and data privacy. Furthermore, underlin-\ning its potential to greatly expand real-time intelligent appli-\ncations across several fields, the authors emphasize important\nresearch difficulties and the need to standardize QFL to enable\nits widespread use in future 6G networks [68].\n2) Quantum Communications: Quantum teleportation and\nentanglement-assisted communication are two examples of\nquantum communication protocols that have a lot of potential\nin theory. However, their use in QFL systems is limited by the\npresent NISQ hardware. The short time that qubits can stay\ncoherent is a big problem. Interactions with their surroundings\nmake qubits lose their quantum state quickly, a process called\ndecoherence. This brief period of stability, which is usually\nmeasured in microseconds, makes it very hard to undertake\nquantum computations and communications that last a long\ntime or are very complicated. This means that for QFL,\nquantum models need to be sent and processed before the\nqubits decohere. This is a challenging problem for distributed\nsystems that function over long distances or with high network\ndelay [70].\nTwo other important hardware problems are low gate fidelity\nand the difficulty of distributing entanglement. Quantum gates,\nwhich are the basic parts of quantum algorithms, include\nbuilt-in error rates. Low gate fidelity indicates that when\noperations are done on qubits, they can make mistakes that\nchange the quantum state, which can lead to wrong results.\nLikewise, distributing high-quality entangled qubit pairs over\nlong distances is necessary for protocols like teleportation, but\nit’s very hard to do because of channel noise and decoherence,\nwhich leads to low entanglement fidelity and slow distribution\nrates. These limitations from the NISQ paradigm make it\nvery hard to communicate using QFL, and any practical QFL\ncommunication scheme must take these hardware flaws into\naccount. This often means using advanced quantum error cor-\nrection methods that are still in the early stages of development\n[71].\nA sophisticated optical quantum communication system\ndesigned for free space situations was improved by optical\ncombining methods and a generic Kennedy receiver. Based\non a thorough quantum channel model generated using the P-\nrepresentation, the system uses a new conditional dynamics-\nbased Kennedy receiver with threshold detection to overcome\nturbulence and thermal noise. In situations with low thermal\nnoise or weak turbulence, the suggested system not only\nminimizes environmental interferences efficiently but also\nsurpasses the traditional quantum homodyne receiver limit,\nthus establishing a new benchmark in quantum communication\nperformance [72]. On the other hand, two creative power\nallocation techniques for multi-hop FSO networks intended\nto maximize system performance are presented to minimize\nupper limits on error probability under quantum limit condi-\ntions [73]. The efficacy of the initial method is assessed by\nthe average error probability that is derived through numerical\nanalysis. The second strategy, which employs closed-form\nerror expressions, simplifies the system at the expense of\nsome performance degradation. By lowering fading effects\nand adjusting the power allocation based on the complete\ninformation of the channel state information (CSI), these\ntechniques greatly improve the dependability and efficiency of\nthe FSO networks overall, exceeding conventional equal power\ndistribution techniques in preserving signal integrity over long\ndistances [74].\nLastly, the evolution and performance of relay-assisted\nsatellite FSO systems employing quantum key distribution\nfor improving vehicle network security are investigated in\nthis article. High-altitude platforms are used as relays to\nhandle issues such as transceiver misalignment, velocity fluc-\ntuations, noise, and atmospheric turbulence, therefore influ-\nencing quantum bit error rates and secret-key generation rates.\nExtensive Monte-Carlo simulations under well-selected system\nparameters—such as intensity modulation depth and amplifier\ngain—show clearly how much safe communication efficiency\nin vehicle networks may be improved [75].\nD. Optimizations for QFL\n1) Model Optimization: Within the context of QFL, model\noptimization plays a crucial role, which refers to the process\nof refining quantum algorithms to enhance the performance\nof quantum models while optimizing resource usage and\nminimizing computational overhead. Model optimization in\nQFL is pivotal for several reasons and involves a series of\ntechniques and strategies designed to improve the efficiency\nof QNNs deployed across multiple decentralized nodes, i.e.,\nquantum devices. Quantum devices operate under significant\nphysical and technological constraints, for example limited\nnumber of qubits, error-prone operations, and short coherence\ntimes. Optimizing QFL models enables proper use of the\navailable quantum resources by reducing circuit depth and\nthe number of required qubits. Besides, model optimization\nfor QFL also reduces the impact of errors on overall model\nperformance. These are highly sensitive quantum systems.\nMoreover, in this era of ever-growing networks, it is important\nto ensure that a QFL algorithm can be extended to larger\nnetworks with numerous quantum nodes without increasing\nthe computational overhead. Effective model optimization\nstrategies enable QFL to scale while maintaining or improving\nthe speed and accuracy of quantum computations. Besides,\nQFL enhances data privacy as data remains local to each\nnode. Enhancing data encoding and quantum state preparation\nthrough different model optimization techniques can lead to\nmore robust models immune to potential quantum threats and\neavesdropping, thereby increasing the overall security of the\nnetwork.\nSeveral optimization techniques are available for enhancing\nthe performance of QFL models. Quantum natural gradient de-\nscent (QNGD) integrates the natural gradient descent concept\nwith QC [76]. Traditional gradient descent approaches assume\na Euclidean geometry where all directions in the parameter\nspace are treated uniformly. However, in the quantum world,\nthis assumption does not hold because the geometry related to\nquantum parameter spaces is inherently non-Euclidean. This\nmeans that the shortest path between two points in the parame-\nter space of quantum states follows a complex trajectory rather\nthan being a straight line. Overlooking this curvature may\nresult in suboptimal updates that fail to accurately represent\nthe actual landscape of the model’s parameters. Furthermore,\ntraditional gradient descent algorithms often exhibit slower\nconvergence rates or may become trapped in local minima,\nleading to inefficient training paths. QNGD addresses this by\ntackling this issue by adjusting the update steps according to\nthe quantum Fisher information metric. This results in a more\nefficient optimization path, leading to faster convergence and\npotentially lower quantum resource usage [77].\nBesides, the VQE is a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm\nthat has been effectively adapted for use within QFL. It was\ninitially developed for quantum chemistry applications to find\nthe ground state energies of molecular systems. Minimizing\na loss function is analogous to finding the ground state of\na Hamiltonian in VQE. This approach not only enhances\ncomputational efficiency and accuracy but also maintains the\ndecentralized and privacy-preserving nature of QFL. Thus,\nVQE serves as a robust method for leveraging quantum\nmechanics in distributed quantum learning networks [78].\nIndividual models can also be optimized at each node in\na QFL framework using quantum annealing (QA). QA finds\nthe optimal parameters for the quantum circuits or models\nused at each node by minimizing a quantum Hamiltonian\nthat represents the loss function of the QFL model. More\nspecifically, this approach is particularly designed to travel\nacross complex energy landscapes by gradually transitioning\nfrom a quantum superposition of many possible states towards\nthe state that minimizes the overall system’s energy, which\nrepresents the optimal solution. Thus, QA is well-known for\nits ability to escape local minima, which is a common issue\nfaced while solving complex optimization problems [79]. All\nthese optimization techniques are quantum-based and can\nperform optimization tasks faster than classical algorithms.\nEspecially, problems where the solution space grows expo-\nnentially with the number of variables can be solved more\nefficiently using quantum-centric approaches. Moreover, as the\nnumber of nodes in QFL increases, so does the complexity of\nthe optimization problem. These quantum-based optimization\ntechniques scale well in such scenarios, handling complex and\nhigh-dimensional landscapes more effectively than classical\napproaches [80].\nWhen comparing these optimization techniques, it becomes\nclear that no single method is universally superior; instead,\ntheir effectiveness is highly context-dependent. For instance,\nQA is highly effective for specific combinatorial optimization\nproblems that can be mapped to an Ising model, leveraging\nspecialized hardware to find global minima [81]. Its applica-\ntion, however, is narrow and not suited for general-purpose\nQML model training. In contrast, VQE and QNGD are more\nversatile as they are designed for training variational quantum\ncircuits. The trade-off lies in their complexity and resource\nrequirements. VQE is more experimentally mature and simpler\nto implement on near-term NISQ devices, but it can be sus-\nceptible to barren plateaus and require an enormous number of\nmeasurements [82]. QNGD, while theoretically more powerful\ndue to its ability to navigate the complex geometry of the\nquantum parameter space for faster convergence, carries a\nsignificant computational overhead in calculating the quantum\nIEEE COMMUNICATIONS SURVEYS & TUTORIALS\nFisher information metric, making it more challenging to scale\non current noisy hardware [83]. The choice of optimizer is\ntherefore a critical trade-off: QA is preferable for specialized\noptimization tasks, VQE is the pragmatic choice for near-\nterm variational circuit training, and QNGD represents a\nmore resource-intensive but potentially more efficient path for\nfuture, more capable quantum processors.\nAlthough there is a lot of potential in these optimization\nstrategies, their practical maturity differs. Numerous methods\nhave been investigated in simulations; nevertheless, exper-\nimental verification on actual quantum hardware is still a\nsignificant obstacle, frequently restricted to proof-of-concept\ndemonstrations on a tiny scale. Table III lists the main QFL\nmodel optimization methods, together with their validation\nstatus, common uses, and main limitations. This comparison\nprovides a more realistic view of their current preparedness\nfor practical QFL implementation by helping to differentiate\nbetween approaches that are primarily theoretical and those\nthat have demonstrated feasibility in experimental settings.\n2) Communication Optimization: While model optimiza-\ntion in QFL involves refining the QML algorithms themselves\nto improve training speed, accuracy, and resource utilization,\ncommunication optimization in QFL concentrates specifically\non enhancing the efficiency and security of data transfer within\nQFL systems [42]. Techniques such as quantum teleportation\nor entanglement-based protocols are used to reduce latency\nand energy consumption by optimizing resource allocation,\nchannel selection, and bandwidth across devices and infras-\ntructure [86]. We note that minimizing latency is crucial for\nsynchronizing updates across distributed quantum nodes to\nfacilitate timely aggregation in the server within a QFL frame-\nwork, thereby enhancing the overall speed and responsiveness\nof the learning process. By selecting optimal communication\nchannels and efficiently, allocating bandwidth efficiently, the\nsystem can handle large volumes of data with minimal de-\nlay, thereby enhancing the overall network performance. For\ninstance, a communication-efficient QFL framework can be\nadapted in the healthcare industry to ensure patient privacy\nwhile optimizing data transmission rates and processing power\nacross quantum networks. This helps reduce operational costs\nand accelerates the timelines for diagnostics and treatments,\nshowcasing the transformative potential of QFL in healthcare\n[87].\nMoreover, quantum devices currently face significant re-\nsource constraints, including limited qubit availability and\nshort coherence times. By optimizing resource allocation,\nenergy consumption is lowered, making the system more\nsustainable and cost-effective. Quantum-enhanced communi-\ncation protocols help in maintaining the integrity and security\nof data transmission, which is pivotal given the sensitive nature\nof the data often handled in QFL setups.\nIncorporating techniques, i.e., quantum key distribution\n(QKD), quantum teleportation, entanglement rate, and QAOA,\ncan significantly enhance the resource allocation, channel\nselection, and bandwidth optimization strategies for commu-\nnication efficiency in QFL environments. QKD is a secure\ncommunication method to enable two parties to generate a\nshared random secret key known only to them that can be\nused to encrypt and decrypt messages. It is considered highly\nsecure because it is based on the laws of quantum mechanics,\nrather than on mathematical problems that could potentially\nbe solved with sufficient computing power. Hence, QKD\ncan be used to secure the communication channels in the\nQFL network [88], ensuring that the transmission of model\nupdates between nodes is protected against eavesdropping.\nQKD resources can be allocated in a dynamic fashion based on\ncurrent network security needs so that the system can maintain\nhigh security without excessive usage of quantum resources\nlike entangled photons, which are also needed for other tasks\nlike quantum teleportation.\nQuantum teleportation is a quantum-enhanced communica-\ntion technique by which quantum information (such as quan-\ntum states representing model parameters) can be transmitted\nfrom one location to another. It harnesses the synergy of classi-\ncal communication and quantum entanglement to facilitate the\ntransmission process. Quantum teleportation can be employed\nto transmit quantum information directly between nodes with-\nout having to send the physical qubits through potentially\ninsecure channels. Since the quantum state itself carries the\nnecessary information, this method can optimize bandwidth\nusage by reducing the amount of classical information needed\nfor model updates. Moreover, the rate of quantum teleportation\ncan be adjusted based on the bandwidth availability and the\nurgency of the updates, helping to manage network load and\nprioritize tasks [89]. Another quantum-centric optimization\nalgorithm is QAOA, which offers a promising approach for\noptimizing communication in QFL environments. It leverages\nthe principles of quantum superposition and entanglement to\nfind the optimal configuration of network parameters that\nminimize latency, energy consumption, and maximize band-\nwidth utilization across a distributed quantum network. These\noptimization techniques are specifically crucial in QFL, where\nefficient communication is important for synchronizing model\nupdates without excessive overhead [90].\nE. Security Mechanisms in QFL\n1) Quantum Key Distribution: QFL improves security and\nprivacy by integrating QC and FL systems utilizing the con-\ncepts of QKD. QKD is a quantum communication system that\nenables two distant participants to generate shared random\ncryptographic keys whose secrecy is guaranteed securely. It\nis inspired by the fundamental laws of quantum physics rather\nthan computational complexity [6]. The security of QKD, in\ncontrast to classical encryption, is based on quantum ideas\nlike entanglement, quantum superposition, and the Heisenberg\nuncertainty principle. This guarantees that any attempt to\neavesdrop will inevitably cause detectable disruptions to the\ntransmitted quantum states [91].\nBennett and Brassard’s 1984 QKD system, BB84, makes\nthe most impactful use of polarized photons delivered in\nrandomly selected polarization bases to create encryption keys.\nAny opponent trying an interception invariably betrays their\npresence due to quantum features such as the no-cloning\ntheorem, which forbids accurate copying of unknown quantum\nstates, as their measurements damage the original quantum\nTable III: Summary of QFL Model Optimization Techniques.\nTechnique\nValidation Status\nPrimary Application\nin QFL\nKey Constraints\nQuantum Natural Gradient Descent (QNGD) [83], [84]\nPrimarily\nSimulated;\nsome small-scale ex-\nperimental demonstra-\ntions exist.\nTraining\nvariational\nquantum circuits (e.g.,\nQNNs) by respecting\nthe\nnon-Euclidean\ngeometry of quantum\nstate space.\nHigh\ncomputational\ncost\nto\ncalculate\nthe\nquantum\nFisher\ninformation\nmetric;\nhighly\nsensitive\nto\nhardware noise.\nVariational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) [82], [85]\nExperimentally\nValidated on various\nNISQ\ndevices\nfor\nsmall-scale\nproblems\nlike\nmolecular\nsimulations.\nFinding optimal model\nparameters\nby\nmap-\nping the loss function\nto a solvable Hamil-\ntonian, which is then\nminimized.\nCan\nsuffer\nfrom\n“barren\nplateaus”\n(vanishing\ngradients)\nin\ndeep\ncircuits;\nrequires\na\nlarge\nnumber\nof\ncircuit\nmeasurements.\nQuantum Annealing (QA) [79], [81]\nExperimentally\nVal-\nidated\non\ncommer-\ncial quantum anneal-\ners (e.g., D-Wave sys-\ntems).\nSolving complex com-\nbinatorial optimization\nproblems that can be\nmapped to an Ising\nmodel Hamiltonian.\nLimited to optimiza-\ntion problems and is\nnot a universal model\nof\nquantum\ncompu-\ntation;\nhardware\nhas\nlimited qubit connec-\ntivity.\ninformation. Beyond BB84, other QKD systems as the Ekert\nprotocol, use quantum entanglement to provide key security by\nBell inequality violations, therefore highlighting even more the\nimportant function of quantum mechanics in safe communi-\ncations [92].\nQKD systems provide excellent defenses against hostile\ndata injection, interception, or illegal access, therefore ad-\ndressing numerous classical vulnerabilities in conventional FL\nenvironments in the scope of QFL. Typically in federated\nsystems, model updates have to be safely sent from edge\ndevices to a central server. Given that the quantum-generated\nkeys are theoretically immune to both classical and quantum\nattacks [93], QKD guarantees that these communications stay\nprivate. Their combined optimization not only allows adaptive\nencryption techniques depending on real-time threat levels and\nnetwork conditions, but also helps QKD be included in QFL.\nQFL can, for example, dynamically change model update rates\nor communication intervals depending on the key refresh rate\nor channel noise in QKD. This co-design enhances not only\nsecurity but also system performance, therefore strengthening\nthe whole framework and increasing its efficiency.\nFurthermore, providing resilience against possible future\nthreats presented by quantum computing itself, quantum-\nsecured FL protects data integrity even against quantum-\nenabled enemies. Integrating QKD into QFL thus marks a ma-\njor step toward really safe, quantum-resistant machine learning\nsystems. It uses the physical rules of quantum mechanics\nto offer a strong security layer, therefore greatly increasing\ntrust and privacy in distributed learning systems and opening\nthe path for future quantum-proof secure communications in\nfederated systems.\n2) Quantum Homomorphic Encryption: QFL presents safe\nand privacy-preserving computations over remote nodes by\nVehicular Networks\nMetaverse\nEdge Server\nEdge Server\nEdge Server\nInformation\nQuantum Processor\nIntelligence\nProcessing local model\nQuantum server\nFig. 6: Detailed Architecture of QFL Framework for Vehicular\nMetaverse Environments: Integration of Edge Servers, Quan-\ntum Processors, and Intelligent Agents for Secure and Scalable\nInformation Processing and Local Model Training in Urban\nVehicular Networks\nincluding quantum computing methods in FL. Among the\nfundamental security systems, Quantum Homomorphic En-\ncryption (QHE) stands out as a useful tool offering quan-\ntum analogs to classical homomorphic encryption. Classical\nhomomorphic encryption preserves privacy and confidential-\nity during processing by letting calculations be performed\non encrypted material without ever decrypting. QHE allows\nquantum computations straight on encrypted quantum states\nwithout compromising security, hence extending this ability\nIEEE COMMUNICATIONS SURVEYS & TUTORIALS\ninto quantum computer domains [94].\nFundamentally using quantum physics ideas, including\nquantum superposition, entanglement, and quantum uncer-\ntainty, QHE improves data confidentiality. QHE guards quan-\ntum data processing against quantum-powered attackers, un-\nlike classical homomorphic encryption that depends on com-\nputational assumptions vulnerable to quantum computational\nattacks (e.g., Shor’s method). First theoretically proposed by\nLiang in 2013, QHE systems preserve the coherence and\nencryption of quantum encrypted states by directly applying\nquantum gates onto them [95].\nBy means of QHE in QFL systems, remote nodes can\nsafely provide encrypted quantum data or quantum-encoded\nclassical data to a central quantum-activated server. After that,\nthe server cooperatively trains advanced quantum-enhanced\nmachine learning models by quantum calculations on these\nencrypted states without decrypting individual data entries.\nThis strategy greatly reduces privacy concerns and stops illegal\ndata flow. Recent studies show that quantum homomorphic\nencryption is especially fit for federated systems, including\nsensitive data such as banking or healthcare, where privacy\nprotection is crucial [65]. Nevertheless, given current quantum\ncomputing constraints, including maintaining coherence, con-\ntrolling quantum noise, and obtaining adequate quantum gate\nauthenticity, effective deployment of QHE in QFL is difficult.\nAlso, these challenges, through continuous study, are gradually\novercoming theoretical and practical constraints, improving\nquantum processing performance and the practical relevance\nof QHE. Thus, a major development in quantum-secured\nFL is quantum homomorphic encryption, which enables safe\ncooperative quantum computations and offers a strong defense\nagainst upcoming quantum adversaries.\n3) Quantum Differential Privacy: QFL employs quantum\ncomputing principles to enhance the privacy and security of FL\nmodels, and one prominent approach is Quantum Differential\nPrivacy (QDP). Differential privacy, traditionally a classical\nconcept, is designed to protect individual data contributions\nby ensuring that the removal or addition of a single data point\ndoes not significantly alter the aggregated statistical outputs,\nthus providing robust privacy guarantees. Quantum differential\nprivacy expands this classical notion into the quantum com-\nputing paradigm, integrating quantum mechanics and quantum\ninformation theory to safeguard sensitive quantum or classical\ndata processed in quantum-enabled FL systems [96].\nAdditionally, QDP involves carefully perturbing quantum\nstates or quantum measurements to limit the disclosure risk\nabout individual quantum states or classical data encoded\nquantumly. This perturbation typically leverages quantum un-\ncertainty, quantum noise, and probabilistic quantum measure-\nment outcomes to ensure strong theoretical privacy guarantees.\nQDP by adapting classical definitions to the quantum domain,\nintroducing a privacy mechanism that employs quantum noise\nthrough carefully designed quantum channels to achieve pri-\nvacy protection [97]. By integrating such quantum mechanisms\nwithin QFL, participants collaboratively train machine learning\nmodels using quantum computations while ensuring individual\ncontributions remain indistinguishable and secure from adver-\nsaries.\nImplementing quantum differential privacy (QDP) in QFL\nframeworks involves encoding sensitive classical or quantum\ndata into quantum states and applying privacy-preserving\nquantum noise operations, such as quantum gates or quantum\nchannels, before aggregation or measurement. These oper-\nations introduce uncertainty, measurement disturbance, and\ninherent noise, which make it significantly harder for adver-\nsaries to infer individual data points from learning outcomes.\nRecent studies demonstrate that QDP can provide stronger\nprivacy guarantees compared to classical differential privacy,\nparticularly in quantum settings. For instance, as shown in\nTable I of [65], the privacy score of the QFL system is as\nhigh as 0.97, which is significantly higher than the traditional\nbenchmarks of 0.80 to 0.90. The improved privacy score, in\nconjunction with a high resilience of 0.95 and communication\nsecurity of 0.93, illustrates that QDP not only enhances privacy\nbut also maintains robust overall system performance in the\nface of quantum threats.\n4) Blind Quantum Computing: Within QFL, Blind Quan-\ntum Computing (BQC) is a fundamental security technique\nthat allows devices to assign quantum computations to strong\nquantum servers without disclosing sensitive quantum data\nor computational tasks. Originally presented by Broadbent et\nal. in 2009, BQC ensures that the quantum server running\nthe computations hides completely the computational input,\nintermediate quantum states, and final output [98].\nBlind Quantum Computing is fundamentally based on the\nintrinsic uncertainty and unpredictability of quantum states,\nmostly obtained by quantum superposition, entanglement, and\ncryptographic obfuscation using randomly generated quantum\nstates. Along with classical instructions encrypted using quan-\ntum principles, the customer generates qubits in randomly\nchosen quantum states and safely delivers them to a quantum\nserver. Ignorant of the precise preparation or computational\ndirections of the quantum states, the server executes quantum\ngates as directed and generates measurement results [99].\nThe device then decodes the results to make sure the server\nlearns nothing significant about the kind or outcome of the\ncomputation.\nParticularly against malicious quantum servers, including\nBQC into QFL, increases privacy inside distributed learning\nsystems. Devices using FL safely offload quantum compu-\ntational activities via BQC protocols, therefore safeguarding\nboth quantum and classical training datasets. BQC thereby\nprotects the collaborative training process, allowing strong\nquantum-enhanced machine learning without violating individ-\nual data privacy [56]. With pragmatic difficulties like quantum\ncoherence maintenance and noise management, continuous\nresearch helps Blind Quantum Computing scalability and de-\npendability to be improved, thus stressing its vital importance\nin safe QFL.\nProviding fundamentals of QFL from its diverse archi-\ntectures and communication schemes to its robust security\nmechanisms, we now turn our attention to its practical impact.\nThe theoretical constructs discussed in this section serve as the\nessential toolkit for deploying QFL in real-world scenarios.\nThe following section will explore how these fundamental\nconcepts are being applied across various innovative domains,\nTable IV: Comparison of solutions addressing different QFL fundamentals.\nTaxonomy\nFundamentals\nDefination and Solution Analyzed in the Literature\nReferences\nFederation Architecture\nFully QFL\n• Each node maintains entirely quantum-based models, typically built\nusing PQC.\n• Approach leverages quantum parallelism and coherence, significantly\nimproving computational efficiency.\n[53]–[56]\nHybrid QFL\n• Combines classical neural network layers with quantum layers.\n• Improved scalability and realistic deployment by blending classical\ncomputing robustness with quantum computing expressivity.\n[57]–[60]\nNetworking Topology\nCentralized QFL\n• Employs a single quantum server aggregating quantum or classical\nmodel updates from multiple distributed quantum clients.\n• A critical point susceptible to single-point failures and potential bot-\ntlenecks.\n[6], [14], [61]\nHierarchical QFL\n• A multi-layered network structure where quantum clients communicate\nwith quantum edge servers for local aggregation before forwarding\nupdates to a central quantum cloud.\n• This multi-tiered structure significantly improves scalability, reduces\nlatency, and mitigates communication bottlenecks compared to central-\nized approaches.\n[62]–[64]\nDecentralized\nQFL\n• Adopts a peer-to-peer communication topology.\n• Enhances fault tolerance, scalability, and privacy protection.\n[65]–[67]\nCommunication Schemes\nClassical\nCommunications\n• Involve exchanging classical model parameters using traditional wire-\nless or wired channels such as 5G/6G networks or Wi-Fi.\n• Ensure broad accessibility and robustness for practical QFL deploy-\nment.\n[15], [68], [69]\nQuantum\nCommunications\n• Transfer quantum states or quantum-encoded information via special-\nized quantum channels.\n• Inherently offers unprecedented security through quantum principles\nlike entanglement and quantum uncertainty.\n[54],\n[72],\n[74], [75]\nOptimizations for QFL\nModel Optimiza-\ntion for QFL\n• Efficiently training quantum or hybrid quantum-classical models, pri-\nmarily through algorithms tailored to PQC.\n• Mitigate barren plateau issues and quantum noise, significantly improv-\ning training effectiveness.\n[76]–[79]\nCommunication\nOptimization\n• Focuses on reducing the overhead associated with exchanging model\nupdates across quantum nodes, employing compression and adaptive\naggregation methods.\n• Selective updates, and adaptive aggregation schedules significantly\nreduce communication bandwidth and latency, facilitating efficient\nscaling of QFL deployments.\n[42], [87]–[89]\nSecurity Mechanisms\nQuantum\nKey\nDistribution\n• QKD securely generates cryptographic keys between quantum nodes\nbased on quantum mechanics principles, enabling inherently secure\ncommunication.\n• Effectively addresses interception risks by leveraging quantum uncer-\ntainty.\n[6], [91]–[93]\nQuantum Homo-\nmorphic Encryp-\ntion\n• Directly on encrypted quantum states, preserving privacy without data\ndecryption.\n• Robustly protects sensitive data during distributed quantum computa-\ntions.\n[65], [94], [95]\nQuantum\nDiffer-\nential Privacy\n• Provided a basic overview and the potential of QFL.\n• Strongly protects against privacy breaches in federated quantum train-\ning.\n[65], [96], [97]\nBlind\nQuantum\nComputing\n• Enables clients to delegate quantum computations securely to quantum\nservers without revealing inputs.\n• Approach robustly safeguards quantum data and computational in-\ntegrity against server-side adversaries.\n[56], [98], [99]\nIEEE COMMUNICATIONS SURVEYS & TUTORIALS\ndemonstrating the tangible benefits and transformative poten-\ntial of QFL in solving critical industry challenges.\nV. APPLICATIONS OF QFL\nBuilding on the fundamental components and taxonomies\nestablished in the previous section, we now shift our focus\nfrom the theoretical blueprint to practical implementation. This\nsection explores the transformative impact of QFL across a\ndiverse range of real-world domains. We will examine how\nQFL is leveraged to solve critical challenges and unlock new\ncapabilities in areas from vehicular and satellite networks to\nhealthcare and the metaverse. For each domain, we discuss\ncurrent state-of-the-art implementations and conclude by syn-\nthesizing the key challenges to outline specific future research\ndirections. A summary of these applications can be found in\nTable V.\nA.\nQFL for Vehicular Networks\nThe vehicular metaverse needs an FL structure that is\ndecentralized, based on quantum mechanics, and aware of het-\nerogeneity. Quantum-based decentralized and heterogeneity-\naware federated learning framework for vehicular metaverse\n(QV-FEDCOM) combines advanced quantum computing ideas\nwith FL to handle the changing and unique needs of vehi-\ncle networks well. A quantum sequential training program\nwith dynamic mode switching and a vehicle-context grouping\nsystem are two important parts that work together to make\ncommunication and data handling faster and better. Using QV-\nFEDCOM is a big step forward in solving the tricky problems\nof the vehicle metaverse, and it looks like it will make things\nrun better and be more flexible [100].\nIn fact, dynamic QFL to enhance vehicular computing and\npublic safety by managing autonomous vehicles more effec-\ntively. The DQFL framework integrates quantum computing\ninto FL to address the challenges posed by the increasing scale\nand data demands of AV networks. It particularly focuses on\nreal-life scenarios, where AVs use QNNs for tasks such as\nimage classification, which is crucial for road safety tasks such\nas license plate recognition. The introduction of DQFL aims\nto revolutionize vehicular computing by optimizing AVs’ data\nprocessing and task execution capabilities, promising signifi-\ncant advancements in public safety and vehicular management\n[101]. Also, a cutting-edge quantum-based FL framework is\ndesigned specifically for the vehicular metaverse. QV-MetaFL\ncombines quantum computing with FL to tackle the unique\nchallenges of vehicular networks, such as data heterogeneity\nand communication efficiency. Key components include the\nquantum sequential training program and the quantum vehicle\ncontext grouping, which together enhance the learning pro-\ncess and data management. QV-MetaFL marks a significant\nadvancement in FL, showing promising results in simulations\nthat underline its potential to transform vehicular computing\nin the metaverse [102]. Here, Equipping every vehicle and\ninfrastructure component within the Internet of Vehicles (IoV)\nwith quantum processors is considered impractical [103]. The\nconcept of the vehicular metaverse presents a strategic alter-\nnative, focusing on managing quantum computations at the\nedge or within virtual environments using dedicated quantum\nservers. This approach optimizes the integration of quantum\ncomputing into vehicular networks, making it more feasible\nand cost-effective [104].\nIn [105], the researcher illustrates, building on the foun-\ndation of integrating quantum computing with vehicular net-\nworks, QFL emerges as a significant advancement over Clas-\nsical FL. By leveraging QNNs, QFL enhances data processing\ncapabilities, model precision, and security, aligning well with\nthe dynamic needs of the vehicular metaverse. In Fig. 6, the\ntransition to QFL represents a crucial step, not just incremen-\ntal, in keeping pace with rapid technological advancements\nand ensuring that vehicular systems do not become obsolete.\nIn particular, the innovative federated QNN introduces quan-\ntum teleportation to optimize resource allocation in wireless\ncommunications, showing enhanced efficiency and effective\npower management in NOMA-based systems [106]. Here,\nresearch highlighted in recent studies explores a QFL-based\napproach that safely and effectively combines local model\nparameters using quantum bits, applicable in both centralized\nand decentralized settings.\nHowever, the authors in [107] propose an optimized QFL\nframework aimed at improving the security of AVs by optimiz-\ning FL hyperparameters against adversarial assaults. Highly\nrobust to adversarial threats like data poisoning, the OQFL\nframework dynamically adjusts learning rates and the length\nof local and global training epochs using a quantum-behaved\nparticle swarm optimization technique. This method not only\nstrengthens the protection mechanism inside the AV ecosystem\nbut also, based on assessments using the MNIST and Fashion-\nMNIST datasets, greatly improves accuracy compared with\nrelated methods. All things considered, OQFL offers a safer\nand effective way for managing private data in distributed\nsituations, hence redefining distributed machine learning in\nAVs.\nMeanwhile, the authors [108] examine the integration of\nquantum communication technologies with FL in autonomous\nvehicular networks, specifically quantum AVNs. The study\ndevelops a system architecture for QAVNs using quantum\nkey distribution algorithms and a space-air-ground integrated\nnetwork model to improve data security and privacy. The\nmain technical paper proposes a safe FL system using local\ndifferential privacy and homomorphic encryption to prevent\ninference attacks, eavesdropping, and Sybil attacks. This study\nimproves FL security in QAVNs and suggests ways to improve\nFL efficiency and privacy in autonomous driving.\nB. QFL for Healthcare Networks\nThe Dynamic Aggregation Quantum Federated Learning\n(DAQFL) technique is intended to improve intelligent diag-\nnosis within the Internet of Medical Things. DAQFL tackles\nthe issues of data heterogeneity in medical settings using\na dynamic weighted aggregation approach that modifies the\nimpact of device data according to real-time performance\nfeedback. This method enhances the precision of the global\nmodel by alleviating the impact of data bias. The DAQFL\ntechnique employs QNNs and constructs VQCs with signif-\nicant entanglement capabilities, thereby improving accuracy,\ntraining speed, privacy protection, and resistance to noise\n[109].\nThe authors [110] introduce a quantum-inspired encryption-\nbased FL system for dementia classification to improve health-\ncare privacy and security. The method uses QKD to protect\nmodel weights during federated CNN training among distant\nhealthcare nodes. QKD protects critical patient data from\ngradient inversion and eavesdropping. This quantum-enhanced\nFL method makes AI-driven diagnostics scalable and secure\nfor resource-constrained settings in low- and middle-income\nnations, boosting quantum medical research.\nBesides, an innovative architecture that combines edge com-\nputing, quantum transfer learning, and FL to transform pain\nlevel evaluation through ECG data processing. This method\ncenters on converting one-dimensional ECG data into two-\ndimensional Continuous Wavelet Transform pictures, which\nare then analyzed using a Quantum Convolutional Hybrid NN\nto improve feature detection and classification. This revolu-\ntionary approach represents a substantial improvement in pain\nassessment, ensuring more precise, secure, and efficient patient\ncare within healthcare technology [111].\nHere, to improve data privacy in healthcare, this research\npresents a new FL system including quantum tensor networks\n(QTNs). To maximize the training of models on distant\ndatasets, the framework uses ideas of many-body quantum\nphysics, hence lowering the demand for significant parameter\nuse and communication bandwidth. This method not only\nguarantees sensitive data using differential privacy analysis\nbut also exceeds conventional FL models in accuracy and\nefficiency. All things considered, the deployment of QTNs\nin federated environments promises notable improvements in\nsafely and effectively managing private healthcare data [112].\nAnother research work proposes a Hybrid Federated Learn-\ning (HFL) architecture designed to protect privacy in applica-\ntions related to mental health. Clustered Federated Learning\n(CFL) and QFL are combined in the framework, whereby\nQFL uses a variational quantum classifier for advanced data\ncategorization and CFL improves device-specific learning\ncharacteristics. By means of extensive testing, QFL demon-\nstrated remarkably high accuracy and recall improvements,\nwhereas CFL exhibited notable increases in precision above\nconventional FL techniques, therefore illustrating the efficacy\nof both methods [113].\nTo transform individualized medicine, the authors in [114]\npresent an artificial intelligence-driven Big Data Analytics\nFramework that specifically blends FL, blockchain, and quan-\ntum computing. Using FL for safe, localized data handling,\nBlockchain for open and safe data transactions, and Quan-\ntum Computing for fast data processing speeds and strong\nencryption, the system improves data privacy, scalability, and\ncomputational efficiency. Demonstrating superior performance\nin diagnostics and patient data management, this architecture\npromises significant advancements in healthcare by improving\ndiagnostic accuracy, treatment efficiency, and data security,\nsetting a new standard for future medical technologies.\nBy offering much improved performance, quantum comput-\ning is a developing technology that could revolutionize data\nprocessing and optimization, especially in healthcare analytics.\nThe possibility of quantum computing to challenge current\ncryptographic systems calls for the development of quantum-\nresistant algorithms, so enhancing safe data exchange in uses\nconnected to health. Furthermore, the integration with big data\nand artificial intelligence systems might transform healthcare\ndata administration, thereby improving patient diagnosis and\nprognosis prediction. These technical developments, which in-\nclude artificial intelligence, big data analytics, FL, blockchain,\nand quantum computing, taken together, are reshining person-\nalized medicine [115].\nOn the other hand, important for estimating hepatic steatosis\nlevels in liver transplantation, this work develops sophisti-\ncated algorithms to improve the categorization of liver biopsy\nimages. Utilizing quantum machine learning for its superior\ngeneralization capabilities, the research introduces a hybrid\nquantum neural network model that significantly boosts di-\nagnostic accuracy. Moreover, to address privacy issues in\nsharing patient data between hospitals, the study employs a\nprivacy-conscious FL approach. Also, this work presents a\nscalable and stable method that aids clinical pathologists in\nenhancing diagnostic efficiency and accuracy in evaluating\nliver diseases [116]. Some recent studies show how well\nartificial intelligence diagnoses liver illnesses, especially via\npicture classification jobs where machine learning shines.\nThese models need confirmation by extensive clinical trials,\neven if their outcomes match those of experts. Furthermore,\na Hybrid Quantum Convolutional Neural Network (HQNN) is\npromising in brain tumor classification and displays faster con-\nvergence than conventional models. Nevertheless, the sparse\navailability of quantum computers and the difficulties in\nmodeling quantum processes on classical systems restrict the\ndevelopment of QML in medicine [117].\nThe authors [118] present, the focus is on data privacy in\nquantum environments, QFL employing quantum data and pro-\ncessors for both devices and servers. Their results imply that\nquantum-inspired approaches might be included in classical\nFL systems to improve security, particularly in delicate fields\nlike dementia detection. This concept might combine quantum\ntechniques with conventional encryption to greatly increase\ndata security in classical systems.\nLastly, maintaining privacy and security of medical data\nis critical in the developing field of healthcare, especially\nin sensitive areas like dementia categorization. Inspired by\nquantum computing, a Quantum-Inspired Privacy-Preserving\nFL framework improves the security and efficiency of FL\nsystems. Using quantum cryptography methods like quantum\nrandom number generators (QRNGs) and QKD, this system\nguarantees the transfer of model changes over collaborating\nnodes. The QFL framework guarantees that every update\nis securely encrypted and that data integrity is kept across\nthe learning process by combining these quantum elements.\nThis not only guards private and sensitive patient information\nfrom possible cyberattacks but also improves the collaborative\nlearning process by enabling the development of more accurate\nand private dementia classification models over dispersed\nhealthcare networks [69].\nIEEE COMMUNICATIONS SURVEYS & TUTORIALS\nC. QFL for Satellite Networks\nQFL was used for the first time in satellite-ground commu-\nnication, utilizing the capacity of LEO satellites to cover the\nentire planet. With adjustable configurations (angle and pole),\nit suggests slimmable quantum federated learning (SQFL) and\nslimmable quantum neural networks (sQNN) that enhance\ncommunication and processing. The possibilities for commu-\nnication are further expanded by superposition coding and\nsubsequent decoding. These authors [69] present the satellite-\nground SQFL framework greatly exceeds conventional FL and\nQFL in efficiency, establishing a new benchmark for satellite\ncommunication systems. The illustration is done in Fig. 7. The\nauthors of [9] also state that standardizing in QFL is necessary\nfor the successful integration of quantum computing with\nFL across many fields. Establishing protocols for quantum\ndevice communication, guaranteeing network compatibility,\nand defining security mechanisms for quantum data and model\nexchanges constitute part of this process. Furthermore, im-\nproving system dependability by standardizing error correction\nfor quantum systems solves fundamental problems such as\nquantum noise and decoherence. Setting these criteria will\nhelp to enable strong, safe, and effective quantum-enhanced\nFL systems by enabling the wider acceptance of QFL in areas\nsuch as telecommunications.\nIn this case, a QFL architecture for SAGIN, which is a\nkey part of the new 6G networks. It handles big datasets\nfor training machine learning models on devices on Earth\nusing VQA and quantum relays, which makes the data safer.\nLocal training is done with VQA, and UAVs and high-altitude\nplatforms (HAPs) are used to send safe quantum relay-based\nmodels over long distances. A case study shows that the VQA-\nbased FL structure and quantum relay system can be used in\nreal life and work well. With quantum approaches and FL in\nSAGIN, 6G networks could have edge intelligence systems\nthat work well and are safe [15].\nMoreover, the authors in [119] investigate the integration of\nquantum deep learning into the fundamental layer of Quantum\nFederated Virtual Reality (QFVR) inside SAGIN, where de-\nvices endowed with quantum capacity perform local training.\nBy amplitude encoding and other approaches, the technical\nwork is to transform local datasets into quantum states and to\nbuild a local quantum model by parameterizing the quantum\ncircuit manipulation of these states. By methodically reducing\na traditionally stated cost function with quantum computing\nmethods, the approach improves the model and therefore\nincreases the security and efficiency of data processing in\nSAGIN.\nIn [120], the main methods applied include the no-cloning\ntheorem, entanglement-based communication, and the inherent\nrandomness of quantum measurement outcomes. The no-\ncloning theorem ensures that exact copying of an unknown\nquantum state is impossible, thereby protecting the FL model\nduring transmission by producing essentially flawed copies.\nEntanglement-based communication greatly enhances security;\nany interception effort disturbs the entanglement, which the\nnetwork can quickly identify as possible eavesdropping. The\nstochastic character of quantum measurements adds another\nAir \nNetworks\nSpace \nNetworks\nSatellite Integrated Sensing and Quantum Communication\nGround-based \nNetworks\nQuantum UAV\nQuantum\nUAV\nHAP\nSatellite\nStation\nQuantum Communications\nSatellite Communication\nQuantum\nLEO\nSatellites\nGEO Satellites\nAreal\nQuantum Server\nQuantum\nServer\nQuantum\nLEO\nSatellites\nServer\nServer\nFig. 7: The illustration of satellite-ground QFL framework.

Lastly, quantum methods\ntaken together provide a strong architecture for safe model\ntransfer in FL applications within SAGIN, therefore greatly\nenhancing data protection against eavesdropping and several\nsecurity issues.\nLastly, the authors [68] present that the future 6G networks\ndepend on SAGINs and the integration of FL and QFL.\nThe goal is to improve these networks using artificial intel-\nligence methods to provide intelligent, real-time applications\nin many spheres, including military operations and emergency\nresponse. Adopting FL and QFL helps to solve issues of\nlarge data, privacy, and security, thereby improving resource\nuse, lowering communication latency, and increasing energy\nefficiency in SAGINs. The benefits of the quantum-activated\ntraining strategy over conventional FL techniques are shown\nby a case study on UAV networks. The paper also addressed\nresearch difficulties and the requirement of standardizing QFL\nimplementation to underline its potential to greatly change\nfuture 6G networks utilizing improved processing capacity and\nsecure communications.\nD. QFL for Metaverse\nTo build the Metaverse, a virtual space for business and\nsocial activities, we need systems that ensure safety, accessi-\nbility, and reliability. To meet these goals, a distributed QFL\narchitecture has been made that uses blockchain technology\n[40]. Blockchain QFL (BQFL) makes the system safer and\nmore open, which makes it more resistant to hacking and\ndishonest behavior. The BQFL system distributed design helps\nto lower the risks that come with having a central server. A lot\nof research, both theoretical and actual, has shown that BQFL\nis useful in the Metaverse, which is a hybrid metaverse made\npossible by a metaverse observer and a world model [8].\nIn addition, this research presents QV-FEDCOM, a novel\nquantum-based, distributed, and heterogeneity-aware FL sys-\ntem especially intended to address the special difficulties of\nthis dynamic environment in the fast-changing domain of\nthe vehicular Metaverse. By combining quantum computing\nideas with FL, QV-FEDCOM offers a flexible and affordable\nsolution improving the interface and functioning of the vehicle\nMetaverse. Furthermore, the application of quantum-inspired\nmain component analysis (Q-PCA) maximizes memory econ-\nomy, hence strengthening the Metaverse architecture. These\ncomponents reinvent learning dynamics and enable the so-\nphisticated needs of the vehicle Metaverse, therefore guiding\nQV-FEDCOM as a pillar for next advancements in this virtual\nworld [100].\nMoreover, the authors presents QV-MetaFL, a quantum-\nbased FL system especially intended for the vehicle Meta-\nverse. Featuring major technologies including the quantum\nsequential-training-program (Q-STP) and quantum vehicle-\ncontext-grouping (Q-VCG), this novel system blends quan-\ntum computing with FL to effectively manage vehicle data\nand communications. These solutions affordably maximize\nlearning processes and solve data heterogeneity problems. All\nthings considered, QV-MetaFL greatly improves the dynamics\nof learning in the vehicle Metaverse, therefore demonstrating\na major advancement in the evolution of virtual cars settings\n[102].\nThis research integrates IoT devices and UAVs to enhance\nreal-world metaverse synchronization. To keep data consump-\ntion minimal when base station resources are limited, offload\nUAV tasks to Web3 cloud servers. The authors also presents\na quantum collective reinforcement learning technique that\nenables UAVs to quickly adjust to new environments, hence\nenhancing their performance in dynamic conditions. Through\neffective data flow and processing management, this method\nimproves Metaverse integration between virtual and real-world\nexperiences [121]. Also, for realistic metaverse systems, this\nresearch introduces a new coordination method aiming at\nimproving synchronization between the physical world and\nthe virtual meta-space. Starting with QMARL to optimize data\ncollecting in physical space for low-delay temporal synchroni-\nsation, uses avatar popularity for creating virtual content under\ndelay constraints, and employs caching strategies based on\navatar popularity and age-of-information to build a realistic\nmeta-space effectively. From lowering computational needs to\noptimizing reality quality in virtual environments, each stage\nis intended to efficiently manage synchronizing issues, thereby\ndemonstrating a complete method to create immersive and\nresponsive metaverse systems [122].\nFinally, the authors improve AI models for self-driving\nand connected cars by using quantum group learning and a\nmany-to-many matching game-based method in a made-up\nmetaverse. The metaverse’s time clock mechanism improves\nsampling, which fixes the problem of not getting enough\ndata when bad weather happens less often. This method\nemphasizes the variety of features across different types of\nvehicle data. This makes it possible to use multiple data\nforms from different vehicle brands more effectively, which\nimproves group learning. This method uses the Gale-Shapley\nalgorithm to play a game of many-to-many matches to get\nthe most vehicles spread out. Spectrum resource allocation is\nalso looked at as a discrete Markov decision process with a\nquantum-inspired reinforcement learning method to find the\nbest way to make the most money for the system [123].\nE. QFL for Network Security\nQuantum Federated Learning IDS (QFL-IDs), a new frame-\nwork intended to improve IDS in consumer networks by\nmixing Quantum Computing with FL. By addressing the\nscalability and privacy concerns related to conventional AI-\nbased IDS, this integration renders QFL-IDS a strong, reli-\nable, and privacy-preserving solution. Using the distributed\ncharacter of FL, QFL-IDS lets several consumer devices\ncooperatively train a global model without violating individ-\nual data privacy. Furthermore, the framework makes great\nuse of quantum computing processing capability to greatly\nincrease the model training and inference process efficiency.\nThe authors show that QFL-IDS provides better detection\naccuracy and computing efficiency than current IDS methods,\ntherefore showcasing its potential to properly and swiftly\nsolve new security challenges [54]. Besides, a unique OQFL\nframework to handle the security issues inside intelligent\ntransportation systems, especially AVs. This framework is\nespecially intended to improve the security of AV ecosystems,\nwhich depend mostly on machine learning algorithms for\noperations and are prone to adversarial assaults, such as data\npoisoning. The OQFL system dynamically changes important\nhyperparameters, like the learning rate and epoch lengths,\nusing a quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization method,\ntherefore strengthening the FL models against such attacks.\nMoreover, the structure is included in a cyber defense plan to\noffer a strong defense against enemy challenges. Benchmark\ndatasets helped to confirm the OQFL framework efficiency in\nimproving security by proving its higher resilience than tradi-\ntional FL methods [107]. In such contexts, a new cyber-attack\ndetection model is proposed to improve network security by\ncombining spatio-temporal attention networks with a quantum-\ninspired federated averaging optimization. The model uses a\nhierarchical model aggregation that dynamically groups nodes\ndepending on network conditions and data similarity, therefore\nimproving the adaptability of cyber-attack detection. It also\nincludes privacy preservation methods and multi-stage model\nrefining, thereby greatly enhancing security and performance.\nIEEE COMMUNICATIONS SURVEYS & TUTORIALS\nTable V: Taxonomy of contemporary QFL applications.\nIssue\nRef.\nTopic\nFederation\nArchitecture\nCommunication\nSchemes\nSecurity\nKey contributions\nLimitations\nQFL for\nVehicular Networks\n[100]\nFramework\ntailored for the\nvehicular\nmetaverse.\nDecentralized\nQuantum\nchannel\nYes\nDynamic Mode Switching,\nVehicle-Context Grouping.\nFocuses solely on Complexity and\nscalability.\n[101]\nDynamic QFL\nfor AVs\nIntegrated QFL\nSystem\nQuantum and\nClassical\nChannels\nYes\nEnhanced AV Computing,\nReal-Life Application\nImplementation Complexity\n[105]\nQFL\nAdvancement\nHybrid\nCentralized-\nDecentralized\nQuantum\nChannel\nYes\nImproved Quantum Teleportation,\nEnhanced Efficiency\nComplexity in Integration\n[107]\nOptimized\nQuantum FL for\nAV Security\nDistributed QFL\nQuantum\nChannel\nYes\nDynamic Hyperparameter\nOptimization\nDependency on Quantum\nOptimization\nQFL for\nHealthcare Networks\n[109]\nQuantum\nMedical\nDiagnosis\nDynamic\nAggregation FL\nQuantum\nChannel\nYes\nWeighted Aggregation, Noise\nResistance\nQuantum Resource Availability\n[110]\nQuantum\nHealthcare\nSecurity\nQuantum-\nEnhanced FL\nQuantum\nChannel\nYes\nQKD Integration, Dementia\nClassification\nQuantum Implementation\nComplexity\n[111]\nQuantum Pain\nAssessment\nEdge-based FL\nQuantum\nChannel\nYes\nECG Image Analysis\nQuantum Computational Demand\nQFL for\nSatellite Networks\n[69]\nSatellite\nQuantum FL\nSatellite-Ground\nFL\nQuantum\nChannel\nYes\nSlimmable QNN, Superposition\nCoding\nDeployment Complexity\n[124]\nQFL\nStandardization\nCross-Sector FL\nQuantum\nChannel\nYes\nProtocol Standardization, Error\nCorrection\nQuantum Noise Challenges\n[15]\nQuantum SAGIN\nVQA-based FL\nQuantum\nChannel\nYes\nQuantum Relay, VQA Integration\nQuantum Infrastructure\nDependency\n[119]\nQuantum Virtual\nReality\nQuantum-based\nFL\nQuantum\nChannel\nYes\nAmplitude Encoding, Quantum\nCircuits\nQuantum Resource Demand\n[68]\n6G Quantum\nSAGIN\nQuantum-\nActivated FL\nQuantum\nChannel\nYes\nReal-Time Applications, Resource\nEfficiency\nStandardization Challenges\nQFL for\nMetaverse\n[8]\nBlockchain\nQuantum\nMetaverse\nDistributed\nBlockchain FL\nQuantum\nChannel\nYes\nBlockchain Integration,\nTransparency\nSystem Complexity\n[100]\nVehicular\nQuantum\nMetaverse\nDistributed\nQuantum FL\nQuantum\nChannel\nYes\nQuantum-inspired PCA\nQuantum Computational Overhead\n[102]\nVehicular\nMetaverse FL\nQuantum-based\nFL\nQuantum\nChannel\nYes\nQ-STP, Q-VCG\nData Heterogeneity Complexity\n[122]\nMetaverse\nSynchronization\nQuantum-based\nFL\nQuantum\nChannel\nYes\nQMARL, Avatar-based Caching\nComputational Demands\n[123]\nQuantum\nAutonomous\nVehicles\nQuantum\nCollective FL\nQuantum\nChannel\nYes\nMatching Game, Quantum RL\nSimulation Complexity\nQFL for Network Security\n[54]\nQuantum FL\nIDS\nDistributed\nQuantum FL\nQuantum\nChannel\nYes\nEfficient Intrusion Detection\nQuantum Resource Dependency\n[107]\nQuantum\nCybersecurity\nAVs\nDistributed\nQuantum FL\nQuantum\nChannel\nYes\nHyperparameter Optimization,\nCyber Defense\nQuantum Complexity\n[125]\nCyber-Attack\nDetection\nHierarchical FL\nClassical\nChannel\nYes\nDynamic Node Grouping\nAggregation Complexity\n[60]\nQuantum-secured\nDSA\nDecentralized FL\nQuantum\nChannel\nYes\nQKD Integration\nQuantum Resource Constraints\n[126]\nQuantum\nAdversarial\nLearning\nQuantum\nFederated\nQuantum\nChannel\nYes\nAdversarial Robustness\nRobustness-Accuracy Tradeoff\n[127]\nQuantum Smart\nGrids\nHybrid Quantum\nFL\nhybrid channel\nYes\nMDI-QKD Optimization\nImplementation Complexity\nThe authors show that the method solves the shortcomings\nof conventional centralized approaches, such as data privacy\nand communication overheads, in identifying several kinds of\nanomalies, so advancing digital network security [125].\nAnother work presents a novel method for improving data-\ndriven security assessments in smart cyber-physical grids:\nthe quantum-secured federated dynamic security assessment\n(QFDSA) system. The system aggregates insights from many\nlocal data sources to forecast system stability by using FL and\nQKD, thereby decentralizing the learning process. By means\nof a secret-key pool and measurement-device-independent\nQKD, QFDSA also manages fast changes in system needs\nand secures data transfers. For real-time dynamic security\nevaluations in smart grids, QFDSA offers a scalable, safe, and\neffective alternative over conventional centralized approaches\noverall [60], [128]. By including adversarial training into QFL,\nthis work pioneers Quantum Federated Adversarial Learning\n(QFAL), hence improving security against adversarial assaults.\nThe method deliberately balances robustness and accuracy\ndepending on device count, adversarial training degree, and\nattack strength by involving devices in creating local adversar-\nial examples and aggregating these using federated averaging.\nEmphasizing the importance of well-calibrated adversarial\ntraining procedures in quantum federated systems, the research\nuncovers a fundamental trade-off between resilience and pre-\ncision [126].\nHowever, inspired to improve stability in smart grids, in-\ncluding renewable energy sources, this work presents the\nQuantum Federated Learning-based Dynamic Security As-\nsessment (QFLDSA) technique. Crucially for grid stability\nevaluations, QFLDSA effectively processes high-dimensional\ndata and complex differential-algebraic equations by combin-\ning hybrid quantum-classical machine learning with FL. With\na high performance and a maximum transmission of model\nparameters down to up to 1000 times, the technique much\nexceeds conventional models. All things considered, QFLDSA\nprovides a strong and dependable method for handling the dy-\nnamic security issues of contemporary smart grids, so opening\nthe path for creative grid management solutions [129]. Lastly,\nthis research [127] introduces QQFL, a new hybrid QFL\ntechnique meant to maximize dynamic security assessment\nin smart grids. QQFL reduces the central weaknesses and\ninefficiencies of conventional ML-based DSA methods by\nmerging measurement-device-independent Quantum Key Dis-\ntribution with Variational Quantum Circuits, hence improving\nboth accuracy and security. Important for the fast-evolving\nsmart grid contexts, QQFL can perform quick online learning\nand dynamic deployment by using a creative use of a DNN-\nbased MDI-QKD optimizer and Quantum Processing Units.\nBy greatly improving security, dependability, and efficiency\nof smart grids, QQFL shows its promise as a strong answer\nfor contemporary smart grid issues.\nF. Application-Specific Challenges and Research Directions\nWhile QFL holds immense promise across various domains,\nits practical realization requires overcoming domain-specific\nchallenges. This subsection outlines key research directions\ntailored to the applications discussed previously, providing a\nroadmap for future investigation.\n• For Vehicular Networks: The primary challenge is the\nhighly dynamic and intermittent connectivity between vehi-\ncles [130]. Future research should focus on developing asyn-\nchronous QFL protocols that are robust to frequent client\ndropouts. Another key direction is designing lightweight\nquantum circuits and model compression techniques suit-\nable for the resource-constrained computational hardware\nin vehicles [131]. A critical research question is: How can\nwe design quantum error correction codes that are efficient\nenough to maintain qubit coherence amidst the constant\nmotion and environmental noise of a moving vehicle?\n• For Healthcare Systems: Data heterogeneity (non-IID data)\nis a major hurdle, as medical data varies significantly across\nhospitals and patient populations. A key research direction\nis the development of personalized or clustered QFL algo-\nrithms that can create specialized models for different data\ndistributions while still benefiting from collective learning\n[109]. Furthermore, ensuring the interpretability of complex\nquantum models is crucial for clinical adoption [132]. This\nleads to the research question: Can we develop hybrid\nquantum-classical models that offer both the predictive\npower of quantum mechanics and the explainability of\nclassical AI for trustworthy medical diagnostics?\n• For Satellite Networks: The extreme distances and harsh\nspace environment pose significant challenges for quantum\ncommunication [133]. The primary research direction is to\ndesign fault-tolerant entanglement distribution protocols for\nlong-haul, free-space optical links. Another focus should\nbe on creating space-resilient quantum hardware [134]. An\nopen question is: What is the optimal trade-off between\non-satellite quantum processing and transmitting quantum\nstates to ground stations, considering the severe bandwidth\nand hardware limitations?\n• For the Metaverse: The Metaverse demands ultra-low\nlatency for real-time immersive experiences [135]. A critical\nresearch direction is the integration of QFL with quantum-\nenhanced edge computing to perform rapid model inference\nand updates at the network edge, close to the user. Ad-\nditionally, developing QFL models for generating complex\n3D assets and dynamic virtual environments is a promising\navenue. A key research question is: How can QFL be used to\ncreate truly personalized and adaptive virtual experiences in\nreal-time without compromising the privacy of user behavior\ndata?\n• For Network Security: The main challenge is the speed at\nwhich QFL models must detect and adapt to new, zero-day\nthreats. Future research should focus on quantum continual\nlearning within a federated framework, allowing security\nmodels to evolve without catastrophic forgetting [118].\nAnother important direction is to explore the use of QFL for\ndetecting adversarial attacks against the quantum machine\nlearning models themselves [125]. This raises the question:\nCan we design a QFL-based intrusion detection system that\nis itself resilient to poisoning attacks targeting the quantum\nparameters of the distributed models?\nIEEE COMMUNICATIONS SURVEYS & TUTORIALS\nVI. LESSON LEARNED\nIn this section, we summarize the key lesson learned from\nthis survey, which provide an overall picture of the current\nresearch on QFL fundamentals and applications.\nA. Fundamentals of QFL and Taxonomy\nThe main lessons acquired from the discussions on QFL\nfundamentals are highlighted in the following:\n• Fully QFL is a wholly quantum architecture in which\nevery federated client preserves entirely quantum-based\nmodels, like VQE employing PQC. Under this archi-\ntecture, quantum calculations are carried out straight on\nquantum data without first producing classical representa-\ntions. Independent quantum computations by local quan-\ntum clients submit quantum or classically measured quan-\ntum parameters to a central quantum server. After that,\nthis central aggregator distributes updated parameters\nand performs quantum averaging, preserving coherence\nand using quantum advantages for maximum processing\nefficiency [53], [54]. On the other hand, hybrid QFL\ncombines quantum layers with classical NNs, whereby\nthe first layers use classical NNs to preprocess and extract\npertinent features, and then send input to quantum layers\nfor further quantum transformations. By using classical\ncomputational resources together with quantum advan-\ntages, this hybridization provides pragmatic benefits that\nimprove scalability and manageability in present NISQ\nsystems. Nevertheless, hybrid QFL adds complexity since\ncareful interface between classical and quantum layers is\nrequired, and improved algorithms for effective parameter\nmapping and optimal training procedures are thereby\nnecessary [55], [56].\n• Simplified hub-and-spoke network topology is used in\ncentralised QFL. Here, several quantum clients interact\ndirectly with a single, strong central quantum server.\nFollowing safe quantum processing, this centralized node\naccumulates quantum model updates from clients and\ndelivers the global model parameters. This architecture is\nfragile despite reduced communication management be-\ncause of possible communication bottlenecks and single-\npoint failure hazards [57], [58]. By comparison, Hierar-\nchical QFL presents a multi-tiered design motivated by\ntraditional hierarchical FL. Clusters of quantum clients\ninteract with intermediate quantum edge computers [59],\n[60]. These edge nodes aggregate initially and then trans-\nfer aggregated quantum updates to a top-tier quantum\ncloud server for global aggregation. Hierarchical orga-\nnization improves fault tolerance, lowers latency, and\nhelps to ease communication congestion by means of\nscalability. Finally, Decentralized QFL uses a peer-to-\npeer network topology, therefore completely removing\nthe need for central servers. Direct exchanges of quantum\nmodel updates between quantum clients with surrounding\npeers offering better resilience against network failures,\ndata privacy, and scalability for large-scale quantum net-\nworks, decentralized quantum consensus algorithms, or\nsecure gossip protocols guarantee convergence towards\na global model. But this distributed topology creates\nsynchronizing problems that call for advanced quantum\nsynchronization and safe quantum communication sys-\ntems [65]–[67].\n• The type of the model updates shared among quan-\ntum nodes determines the communication inside QFL\nsystems. Standard classical communication channels fit\nwhen updates incorporate classical parameters, usually\nnumerical values received from quantum observations.\nReliable and fast transmission made possible by conven-\ntional wireless technologies, including Wi-Fi or cellular\nnetworks (5G/6G), helps to enable extensive integration\ninto current infrastructure. But when updates consist\nof quantum states themselves, conventional transmission\nfalls short [6], [61]. Then quantum communications\nmust be used, making advantage of quantum-specific\ntransmission technologies such as fiber-optic cables or\nFSO networks. Using QKD, entanglement-based com-\nmunication, or quantum teleportation, these quantum\nchannels provide safe, coherent, and interference-resistant\ntransfer of quantum states. Because of basic quantum\nphysics ideas like the no-cloning theorem and quantum\nuncertainty, quantum communication systems naturally\nprovide better security against conventional interception\nefforts. Nonetheless, actual implementation presents ma-\njor difficulties like quantum decoherence over distances,\nrestricted channel capacity, and complicated hardware\nneeds, which call for continuous development in quantum\ncommunication technologies [14].\n• In QFL, optimization methods center on improving model\ntraining efficiency, convergence rates, and communication\nefficacy. Mostly using VQAs, model optimization tech-\nniques consist of parameter optimization within quan-\ntum or hybrid models. The quantum-specific difficulty\nof barren plateaus (vanishing gradients) requires care-\nful design of optimization strategies. Techniques includ-\ning adaptive parameter initialization, noise-aware train-\ning methods, and hybrid quantum-classical optimization,\nleveraging classical algorithms like gradient descent or\nevolutionary algorithms, greatly improve model training\nresults. On the other hand, communication optimization\ntackles the model update transmissions’ overhead reduc-\ntion. Communication efficiency is much improved by\nmethods including selective update transmission, adap-\ntive federated averaging schedules, and quantum model\ncompression. Furthermore, quantum-secured aggregation\ntechniques maximize privacy and lower pointless data\ninterchange, therefore guaranteeing less resource con-\nsumption. Dynamic communication frequency based on\nclient performance and network conditions helps to fur-\nther enhance general resource use and scalability, hence\nmaking QFL more sensible for actual implementation.\n• Strong quantum-enhanced security methods are de-\nmanded by QFL. Utilising quantum uncertainty and en-\ntanglement, QKD securely exchanges cryptographic keys\nusing quantum physics. Using protocols such as BB84,\neavesdropping is guaranteed, therefore shielding feder-\nated nodes against interception attacks [94], [95]. Direct\nquantum computations on encrypted quantum states made\npossible by QHE help to preserve data privacy during\nmodel development. QHE guarantees that quantum nodes\ncooperatively compute without disclosing sensitive in-\nformation, hence reducing data leakage hazards inher-\nent in distributed learning systems. Analogously, QDP\nuses quantum noise insertion to hide the quantum states\nof individual data points, hence extending conventional\ndifferential privacy notions to quantum domains. This\nmethod firmly protects participant privacy, therefore stop-\nping adversaries from deducing private or operational\ndata [65], [96], [97]. At last, BQC lets customers safely\nassign quantum calculations to quantum servers with-\nout disclosing quantum states or computation specifics.\nBQC guards computational integrity and quantum data\nby sending encrypted quantum inputs alongside classical\ninstructions. These quantum security mechanisms taken\ntogether greatly improve the resilience, privacy protec-\ntion, and trustworthiness of QFL systems against both\nquantum and classical adversaries [56], [98].\nSynthesizing these fundamentals reveals several critical\ntrade-offs and unresolved challenges that define the current\nQFL landscape. A primary practical consideration is the\narchitectural choice between the near-term feasibility of hybrid\nQFL systems and the long-term potential of fully quan-\ntum architectures. While hybrid models are more compatible\nwith today’s NISQ-era hardware, they introduce significant\noverhead in managing the classical-quantum interface [57].\nThis leads to a key unresolved challenge: the compatibility\nbetween classical FL protocols and quantum nodes. For\nexample, classical aggregation algorithms are not designed to\nhandle quantum state vectors, necessitating new protocols that\ncan efficiently merge quantum information without resorting\nto costly measurements that destroy quantum advantages.\nFurthermore, an inherent trade-off exists between the oper-\national simplicity of centralized QFL [68] and the robust-\nness of decentralized topologies [8]. The latter introduces\nprofound practical challenges in synchronizing distributed\nquantum states and managing entanglement across a peer-to-\npeer network with emerging, and often unreliable, quantum\ncommunication constraints.\nB. Applications of QFL\nThe main lessons acquired from the discussions of QFL\napplications are highlighted in the following:\n• For vehicle networks, QFL offers transforming possibil-\nities that will allow Intelligent Transportation Systems\n(ITS) safe, effective, and real-time decision-making. To\nmaximize traffic flow, route planning, accident avoidance,\nand autonomous driving decisions, vehicles nowadays\ndepend more and more on distributed machine learning.\nBy using the increased processing capability and quantum\nencryption features of quantum computation, QFL solves\nintrinsic constraints of classical FL, like latency and\ndata security problems [100]. Fast analysis of large data\nstreams produced from sensors and vehicle-to-anything\n(V2X) communications by quantum-enhanced models\ngreatly improves prediction and autonomous reaction\naccuracy. Furthermore, using QKD in vehicle networks\nguarantees safe model update transfers, therefore safe-\nguarding important vehicle location and user behavior\ndata against cyberattacks or illegal access. Furthermore,\neffective coordination of vehicle clustering by quantum-\nenhanced optimization algorithms improves cooperative\ndriving and lowers communication overhead. Although\npresent hardware limitations in quantum devices, the\nongoing development toward strong quantum communi-\ncations and computation systems shows the viability and\nsignificant future influence of including QFL into vehicle\nnetworks. Adoption of QFL inside vehicle environments\ncan eventually greatly improve traffic efficiency, general\nnetwork dependability, and safety [105].\n• QFL presents a novel approach to safely manage private\npatient data in healthcare systems, hence improving com-\nputational accuracy in disease prediction, diagnosis, and\ntailored treatment. Large-scale, extremely private datasets\ncreated by healthcare apps are spread throughout medical\nfacilities and hospitals [109]. Advanced quantum encryp-\ntion available from QFL guarantees strong data protec-\ntion during federated training by means of QHE and\nQDP. Beyond traditional computing constraints, quantum-\nenhanced ML models allow exact analysis of massive\nbiomedical datasets, fast extraction of important insights\nlinked to drug discovery, medical imaging, or patient\nrisk assessments. Moreover, using quantum communica-\ntion guarantees safe and consistent distribution of model\nupdates, which enables hospitals to cooperatively train\nworldwide models without directly exchanging patient\ndata, while carefully following privacy rules [110]. Fur-\nthermore, accelerating computationally demanding activi-\nties like molecular modeling or genetic sequence analysis\nis a quantum computing ability. Quantum hardware noise,\nlimited coherence durations, and the requirement of inte-\ngrating quantum-classical hybrid designs pose difficulties\n[111]. Future developments in quantum infrastructure\nand algorithmic refinement could completely materialize\nQFL’s transforming power, therefore giving healthcare\npractitioners fast, accurate diagnostic tools and transform-\ning patient-centric, tailored therapy.\n• By transcending special limitations including latency,\ndata privacy, and security risks, QFL can significantly\nhelp satellite networks to support real-time decision-\nmaking, surveillance, and communication management.\nSatellites generate vast observational data, needing fast,\ndispersed processing [69]. By allowing satellites to co-\noperatively train complex ML models, QFL quantum-\nenhanced algorithms help to greatly reduce the raw data\ntransmission and therefore preserve limited bandwidth.\nBy avoiding interception and thereby reducing risks from\ncyber threats inherent in satellite communications, using\nquantum communication links, such as FSO quantum\nchannels, improves data security. Furthermore, quan-\ntum optimization methods enhance satellite constellation\nmanagement by exactly optimizing orbital positions and\nlowering collision hazards [15]. Especially in military\nIEEE COMMUNICATIONS SURVEYS & TUTORIALS\nand critical infrastructure applications, the inherent re-\nsilience of QFL against classical computational hazards\nguarantees the security of crucial satellite operations.\nStill, there are significant practical challenges for QFL\ndeployment in satellite networks, including quantum state\ndecoherence over space-bound transmission channels,\ntechnological limits in space-compatible quantum hard-\nware, and consistent quantum entanglement distribution.\nNotwithstanding these difficulties, fast developments in\nquantum satellite technology and quantum communica-\ntion show a bright future for extensive QFL implementa-\ntion, so greatly improving satellite network security, data\nintegrity, and efficiency [68].\n• Promising prospects for the growing Metaverse ecosys-\ntem, QFL addresses important issues including data secu-\nrity, effective distributed processing, and immersive real-\ntime experiences, therefore tackling essential problems.\nRequiring strong, scalable, and safe computational re-\nsources, the Metaverse mostly depends on large-scale\ndistributed data analysis and real-time rendering [8]. By\ncombining the parallel processing capacity of quantum\ncomputing with quantum-secure techniques, QFL greatly\nincreases the accuracy and speed of predictive analytics\nand immersive simulations. Real-time, privacy-preserving\ninteractions among geographically scattered participants\nmade possible by quantum-enhanced federated training\noffer improved user experiences and customization of\nadaptive content [122]. Crucially for trust-building and\nuser privacy in virtual environments, using quantum cryp-\ntography techniques such as QKD and BQC guarantees\nsafe, tamper-proof user interactions. But the latency-\nsensitive character of the Metaverse puts strict criteria\non quantum communication infrastructure, which calls\nfor creativity to lower transmission delays and deco-\nherence. Notwithstanding present quantum technological\nconstraints, developments in quantum internet prototypes\nand quantum error-reducing techniques point to a feasible\nroute towards useful QFL incorporation into Metaverse\nplatforms. Adoption of QFL can ultimately transform\nMetaverse applications by offering highly immersive,\nsafe, and interactive worlds at hitherto unheard-of com-\nputing sizes [123].\n• By offering a safe, dispersed framework for threat iden-\ntification and mitigation across distributed systems, QFL\ngreatly increases network security. Scalability, data pri-\nvacy, and vulnerability to targeted cyberattacks pose dif-\nficulties for conventional centralized solutions to network\nsecurity [107]. Using quantum-enhanced federated algo-\nrithms, QFL lets distributed nodes cooperatively identify\nanomalies and hostile behavior in real-time without dis-\nclosing private security data. Utilizing improved pattern\nrecognition and anomaly detection algorithms function-\ning outside of conventional computational boundaries,\nquantum computing inherent capabilities improve the\nidentification of complex cyber threats [125]. Further-\nmore, providing intrinsically safe routes for transmit-\nting important security-related model updates, quantum-\nsecured communication systems, including QKD, helps to\nprevent interception and guarantee data integrity. Further\nensuring confidentiality, QDP lets nodes safely distribute\nmodel parameters without violating private operational\ndata [127]. Still difficult, nonetheless, actual integration\nof QFL into network security is hampered by noisy\nquantum technology, restricted scalability, and quantum\nresource availability. QFL’s ability to transform network\nsecurity becomes more feasible as quantum technologies\ndevelop, enabling more stable quantum hardware and\nlarger-scale quantum network infrastructures, therefore\nproviding durable, privacy-preserving defense mecha-\nnisms against developing threats.\nAcross all these promising applications, a common set\nof practical\nconsiderations and unresolved\nchallenges\nemerges, primarily centered on hardware readiness and com-\nmunication infrastructure. For domains like satellite and ve-\nhicular networks, the physical deployment of fragile, environ-\nmentally sensitive quantum hardware remains a monumental\nhurdle. This highlights a crucial trade-off: the pursuit of\nquantum-enhanced performance versus the immense overhead\nand cost of developing and maintaining the necessary quan-\ntum infrastructure. A significant unresolved challenge is the\nabsence of a mature “Quantum Internet” capable of reliably\ndistributing entanglement over long distances, which is a pre-\nrequisite for many advanced QFL protocols. These emerging\ncommunication constraints such as high decoherence rates\nin optical fiber and free space—mean that the performance\nof QFL in practice is currently bottlenecked by the physical\ntransmission of quantum states, not just by quantum computa-\ntion. Consequently, a key practical consideration for any real-\nworld QFL application is the co-design of quantum algorithms\nwith the noisy, resource-constrained hardware and networks\navailable in the NISQ era.\nVII.

A Case Study\nWe present an example from our research to show how QFL\ncan be useful in the real world. In this case, we used QFL to\nfind unusual patterns (anomalies) in a system to see if using a\nquantum-based approach can enhance the detection accuracy\nof anomalies.\n1) Overview: Detecting unusual patterns is essential for\nkeeping today’s smart systems secure and running smoothly.\nThese irregularities can point to things like fraud, equipment\nfaults, or cybersecurity attacks illustrate in Fig.\n8. For the\ntraditional approach, there are three main types of anomaly\ndetection techniques—reconstruction-based (RE) [156]–[158],\nclassification-based (CF) [159]–[162], and constructive learn-\ning (CL) approaches [163]–[165]. Although traditional ma-\nchine learning methods are often used for detecting anomalies,\nthe detection of anomalies has some unique problems and\nchallenges. i) Acquiring vast amounts of abnormal data is\nnaturally challenging. ii) The distinctions between regular and\nabnormal events are sometimes extremely small in size. iii)\nSpecific learning approaches and cost-sensitive solutions are\nfrequently necessary to address the data imbalance, increasing\ncomputational and design complexity. iv) Finally, the defini-\ntion of an anomaly varies greatly depending on the context. A\npattern that appears abnormal in one area or system may be\nperfectly acceptable in another.\nQML can surpass traditional ML techniques in anomaly\ndetection by overcoming fundamental constraints with the\nunique features of quantum. QML allows data to be encoded\ninto high-dimensional quantum spaces, allowing models to\nlearn efficiently even from sparse anomalous samples. For\nexample, [166], [167] presented a QNN method that enables\nFalse Detection\nAnomaly\nNormal\n(Dog)\nMissing Detection\nAnomaly\nAnomaly\n(Bird)\nClient 1\n(with cat images)\nClient 2\n(with dog images)\nFig. 8: An example of false and missed detection issues in\nQFL anomaly detection on CIFAR-10 data. In this case, cat\nand dog photographs are initially regarded as normal. False\ndetection occurs when a dog image is considered a cat, and\nmissing detection occurs when a bird is considered a cat or a\ndog.\nfeature extraction and dimensionality reduction at the same\ntime for industrial quality control by combining a classifier\nand an autoencoder. [168] used QNNs to recover damaged or\nmissing data, emphasizing the significance of precise quantum\nstate preparation. Despite these encouraging research efforts,\nQML presents some limitations. The traditional method in\nQML of using a single server to handle data from several\nsources raises data privacy issues. Data centralization in QML\nis particularly dangerous for applications that require private\nor sensitive data since it leaves the data vulnerable to breaches\neither in transit or on the central server, which might lead to\ndata-related attacks on the system. Furthermore, QML requires\nsubstantial quantum processing power to carry out compu-\ntations on the central device. Quantum resources, including\ncoherent quantum gates and quantum bits, are still in the early\nstages of research and can be costly and challenging to sustain\nover time.\nAs a result, we provide an anomaly detection approach\nbased on Quantum Federated Learning (QFL) to overcome\nthese difficulties. QFL combines the power of quantum com-\nputing with the privacy benefits of federated learning, allow-\ning numerous clients to train models simultaneously without\nsharing raw data. This strategy eliminates the need for central\ndata gathering, lowers privacy risks, and promotes learning\nfrom decentralized, non-IID data. Simultaneously, quantum\nimprovements improve the accuracy with which unusual and\nsubtle abnormalities are represented. By spreading quantum\nlearning across clients, QFL eliminates the need for centralized\nquantum resources, addressing privacy and scalability prob-\nlems while enhancing anomaly detection performance.\n2) Proposed Method: Our approach to anomaly detection\naddresses two common problems: false and missed detections,\nas discussed in [165]. A false detection occurs when something\nnormal, such as a regular image of a dog, is incorrectly iden-\ntified as an anomaly (it is not a dog). This frequently occurs\nbecause each client (device or system) has different types of\ndata, which can be confusing. On the other hand, a missed\ndetection occurs when a genuine anomaly, such as an image\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nRounds\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\nFE (%)\nQFL\nQML\nFL\n(a) FE (%)\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nRounds\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50\nME (%)\nQFL\nQML\nFL\n(b) ME (%)\nFig. 9: Training performance comparison between QFL, QNN, and FL approaches. we compared both FE (%) (a) and ME\n(%) (b) in anomaly detection where we use CIFAR-10 as normal dataset and CIFAR-100 as anomaly dataset.\nof a bird, goes unnoticed and is identified as a dog, which\ngenerally occurs because the client lacked sufficient similar\ndata to recognize it as an anomaly. To address these issues,\nwe first set up a shared reference (a global density function)\nthat allows all clients to agree on what is ”normal” and what\nis not, and we add some noise to keep data private. Second,\nwe use contrastive learning, a type of training that teaches the\nsystem to bring similar (normal) items closer together while\npushing different (anomalous) items apart. Finally, rather than\nsimply combining model weights, we employ an ensemble\ndistillation strategy that focuses on how well local models\ndetect anomalies, applying their strengths to guide the training\nof a more accurate global model.\nWe investigate a hybrid quantum-classical approach, more\nspecifically VQE, for anomaly detection. The proposed QFL\nframework is designed around a central server and n dispersed\nclients. Each client has its private data for finding unusual\npatterns. They train a model using just their data and never\nshare the raw information, so privacy is protected. The central\nserver doesn’t have access to the data—it just collects the\nresults from each client’s training, combines them to make\na better overall model, and sends that back to the clients.\nThis cycle keeps repeating, allowing everyone to learn together\nwithout sharing private data.\nEach client trains a local anomaly detection model with a\nQNN based on PQCs. This procedure starts with encoding\nclassical input characteristics into quantum states using meth-\nods like angle or amplitude encoding, which allows the data\nto be represented in a quantum Hilbert space. Once encoded,\nthe quantum states are sent via a series of parameterized\nquantum gates that comprise the PQC. These gates determine\nthe model’s learnable structure, and their parameters change\nthroughout training. After the circuit, quantum measurements\nturn the quantum state back into classical information, which\nis then utilized to compute the loss and change the parameters\nusing gradient-based algorithms. After local training, clients\nsimply send their PQC parameters to the central server; no data\nor quantum states are transferred. The server aggregates model\ndata via a federated averaging approach, which integrates\nparameter sets from all clients into a single global model.\nThis revised model gathers information from various data\ndistributions and broadcasts it to clients to start a new training\nround. This cycle repeats for numerous global rounds before\nthe model stabilizes.\n3) Illustrative Results: To evaluate the performance of\nour QFL-based approach, to represent normal data, we use\nthe baseline dataset CIFAR-10 [169]. This dataset contains\na diverse but uniformly labeled collection of images across\nten classes. For anomaly data, we use CIFAR-100 [169]\nand Tiny-ImageNet [170]. CIFAR-100, with its 100 classes,\noffers greater diversity, while Tiny-Imagenet, with its larger\ndimensions, provides a more detailed comparison. We employ\ntwo common anomaly detection metrics, AUROC (Area Under\nReceiver Operating Characteristic Curve) [171] and AUPR\n(Area Under Precision-Recall Curve) [172], where higher\nvalues indicate better performance, as well as False Error\n(FE), which calculates the rate of normal samples that are\nmistakenly classified as anomalies, and Missing Error (ME),\nwhich calculates the rate of actual anomalies missed.\nFirst, to show the effectiveness of QFL, we compare QFL\nwith QNN and FL in Fig. 9 and compare using FE and\nME. The figure shows that QFL consistently performs better\nthan both QNN and FL, staying on top across all training\nrounds—even though its scores slowly go down over time.\nFor example, QNN performance drops from 18.5 to 11.0 in\none case (FE) and from 35.0 to 19.4 in another (ME). QFL\nalso drops, but it starts lower and still ends up with the best\nresults—going from 15.6 to 7.77 in FE and from 24.6 to 15.2\nin ME. In short, QFL gives the most accurate results overall.\nFinally, A thorough performance comparison between\nIEEE COMMUNICATIONS SURVEYS & TUTORIALS\nNormal\nDataset\nAnomaly\nDataset\nMethod\nFE (%) ↓\nME (%) ↓\nAUROC (%) ↑\nAUPR (%) ↑\nCIFAR-10\nCIFAR-100\nRE\nAE [156]\n45.6 ± 0.8\n48.9 ± 1.2\n55.8 ± 0.9\n56.0 ± 2.0\nFedDetect [157]\n46.2 ± 1.2\n54.9 ± 0.9\n56.4 ± 0.9\n55.9 ± 0.9\nCF\nOCSVM [160]\n46.2 ± 1.8\n47.3 ± 1.9\n54.8 ± 1.2\n55.2 ± 1.3\nDeep-SVDD [161]\n48.6 ± 1.2\n46.4 ± 0.8\n53.9 ± 1.5\n56.2 ± 1.2\nPanda [162]\n47.6 ± 0.7\n46.3 ± 1.2\n55.5 ± 1.5\n54.2 ± 0.4\nCL\nCSI [163]\n43.2 ± 0.8\n42.8 ± 2.0\n58.6 ± 1.1\n61.1 ± 0.8\nElsa [164]\n46.2 ± 1.2\n40.1 ± 2.7\n54.0 ± 1.0\n56.3 ± 2.7\nFADngs [165]\n30.6 ± 1.0\n25.0 ± 0.6\n77.8 ± 0.9\n75.1 ± 0.9\nQNN [167]\n20.5 ± 1.4\n19.0 ± 1.7\n81.0 ± 0.8\n85.6 ± 1.1\nQFL\n7.77 ± 1.8\n15.2 ± 1.0\n85.2 ± 2.1\n94.1 ± 2.2\nTiny-\nImageNet\nRE\nAE [156]\n48.0 ± 0.8\n40.9 ± 0.8\n55.1 ± 1.4\n52.6 ± 0.9\nFedDetect [157]\n48.1 ± 1.8\n53.9 ± 1.0\n55.9 ± 1.0\n53.03 ± 1.0\nCF\nOCSVM [160]\n48.4 ± 1.6\n47.7 ± 3.0\n52.5 ± 1.5\n51.8 ± 1.6\nDeep-SVDD [161]\n48.2 ± 0.8\n48.2 ± 1.4\n52.6 ± 2.2\n51.4 ± 0.9\nPanda [162]\n47.8 ± 0.4\n48.5 ± 1.5\n52.2 ± 2.0\n51.6 ± 0.6\nCL\nCSI [163]\n43.6 ± 0.6\n42.0 ± 3.3\n59.1 ± 0.9\n60.4 ± 0.8\nElsa [164]\n47.2 ± 1.4\n47.7 ± 1.7\n54.4 ± 0.5\n53.8 ± 1.7\nFADngs [165]\n25.1 ± 1.0\n20.2 ± 2.3\n83.8 ± 0.9\n82.8 ± 1.1\nQNN [167]\n15.9 ± 0.9\n18.7 ± 1.6\n81.8 ± 0.9\n87.3 ± 2.9\nQFL\n10.6 ± 1.7\n12.5 ± 2.9\n85.9 ± 2.1\n91.2 ± 1.7\nTable VI: A Comparative analysis of anomaly detection methods across CIFAR-100 and Tiny-ImageNet datasets, showing\nperformance metrics such as False Error (FE), Missing Error (ME), AUROC, and AUPR for various methods.\nmultiple anomaly detection techniques evaluated in two\nsettings—CIFAR-10 (normal data) against CIFAR-100 and\nTiny-ImageNet (anomalous data)—is shown in Table VI. Tra-\nditional RE techniques, such as FedDetect [157] and AE [156],\ndisplay greater FE and ME rates in both cases, suggesting\nthat they are not very robust in identifying abnormalities in\ndecentralized systems. Similarly, CF techniques like OCSVM\n[160], Deep-SVDD [161], and Panda [162] exhibit slight\ngains but continue to have issues with recall and detection\nprecision. Recent CL techniques such as CSI [163] and Elsa\n[164] demonstrate a better balance between false and missing\nerrors, while FADngs [165] federated contrastive learning\ndesign helps it achieve significant improvements in AUROC\nand AUPR. Our suggested QFL approach, however, performs\nbest on all measures, showing the best AUROC and AUPR\nvalues in all settings and noticeably reduced false and missing\nerror rates. When comparing CIFAR-10 to CIFAR-100, QFL\noutperforms even the quantum baseline QNN, lowering the\nFalse Error to 7.77%, the Missing Error to 15.2%, and\nachieving an AUROC of 85.2% and AUPR of 94.1%.

These findings show that QFL is a reliable\nand privacy-preserving solution for federated systems as it\nnot only retains good anomaly detection performance but also\nsuccessfully adjusts to various anomaly distributions. This also\nhighlights QFL’s ability to handle complex, multidimensional,\nand context-dependent data while maintaining data privacy.\nAs quantum hardware advances, QFL has the potential to be\na fundamental method in safe and intelligent decentralized\nsolutions to real-life problems.\nThis case study provides a concrete example of how the\ntheoretical elements of QFL can be integrated using current\nplatforms to deliver tangible performance and security bene-\nfits. While such demonstrations are crucial for validating the\npromise of QFL, they also highlight open issues. Building\nupon these practical insights, the final section of our survey\nwill now broaden the scope to address the key unresolved chal-\nlenges, open research questions, and exciting future directions\nthat will shape the next phase of Quantum Federated Learning.\nVIII. CHALLENGES AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS\nIn this section, we discuss a few important research chal-\nlenges and potential solutions toward efficient QFL.\nA. System Heterogeneity in QFL\nSystem heterogeneity is a major challenge due to the vari-\nability in the quantum capabilities of edge devices. One key\nsource of this heterogeneity is the difference in the number of\nqubits available on each participating device. Each quantum-\npowered edge device may have access to a different number\nof qubits, which influences the complexity of QML models\nthat can run. Devices with fewer qubits are constrained in the\nsize and complexity of the quantum circuits they can process,\nwhile those with more qubits can handle larger, more intricate\nmodels. This difference in quantum resources complicates the\nprocess of sharing model updates across devices, as the models\ntrained on each device may differ significantly in complexity\nand size [173], [174].\nAnother aspect of heterogeneity in QFL arises from the vari-\nation in parameterized gate layers between devices. Quantum\ncircuits used for QML typically consist of multiple layers of\nparameterized gates, but not all quantum devices are capable\nof supporting the same level of complexity in these circuits.\nSome devices can implement deeper or more complex gate\nlayers, offering greater flexibility in how quantum states are\nrepresented and optimized, while others may be limited in\ntheir gate depth. These disparities in gate layer capabilities\ncreate inconsistencies in the models trained on different de-\nvices, making it difficult to aggregate the model updates in\na standardized way. To address this, advanced techniques are\nrequired to ensure that the model updates can be effectively\nintegrated and the training process remains consistent across a\nheterogeneous network of quantum devices [175]. In terms of\ndesigning adaptive QFL algorithms that dynamically change\nlearning rates, communication intervals, or circuit complexity\nto fit each node hardware limits and fidelity levels is part of\nfuture directions.\nB. Quantum Noise Control in NISQ-based QFL\nControl of quantum noise is a major obstacle for QFL in\nNoisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) systems. These\ndevices are prone to decoherence, gate mistakes, and measure-\nment errors, as by definition their qubit counts and coherence\nperiods are limited [178], [185]. In QFL settings—where\nseveral quantum nodes collaboratively train a global model\nutilizing PQCs—noise can accumulate unpredictably across\nvarious nodes, creating uneven error rates and perhaps skewing\nfederated model updates. Because gate fidelities and noise\nlevels differ between customers, this heterogeneity sometimes\nresults in slower convergence or less-than-ideal performance.\nAdditionally, an important limitation is the low viability of\nfull-scale QEC in current NISQ systems. Rather, to somewhat\noffset the consequences of noise, researchers depend on error-\nmitigating techniques, including zero-noise extrapolation and\nprobabilistic error canceling. But such methods can call for\nrepeated circuit runs—an overhead that would not be feasi-\nble for geographically scattered or resource-limited quantum\ndevices in a QFL system. Furthermore, it is still difficult to\ncreate QFL protocols that balance local training stages with\ncommunication on noisy channels since conventional feder-\nated averaging might not consider important error variations\nbetween nodes [177].\nFuture initiatives include the development of noise-aware\nQFL algorithms that dynamically change the learning rate\nor depth of quantum circuits depending on real-time de-\nvice authenticity measurements. Using hybrid error-correcting\ntechniques—that is, partial QEC or quantum error detection\ncodes—to stop critical error propagation without the complete\nexpense of fault-tolerance offers still another interesting path.\nFurthermore, dynamically arranging activities across nodes\nwith different noise levels—possibly via flexible scheduling\nor quantum resource pooling—may improve dependability\nand performance in large-scale installations [173]. Together\nwith continuous hardware advances, these techniques represent\nimportant milestones toward a strong and scalable NISQ-based\nQFL.\nC. Standardization\nEstablishing industry-wide standards and regulatory frame-\nworks becomes ever more important as QFL advances\nfrom conceptual development toward practical implementa-\ntion. Consistent rules are needed to guarantee interoperability,\nsecurity, and dependability across heterogeneous platforms\nsince QFL uses distributed learning topologies, quantum com-\nputing capabilities, and advanced cryptographic protocols like\nQKD [179]. Such guidelines would include issues including\nuniversal performance criteria for PQCs, data interchange\nformats between quantum and classical systems, and protocol\ndefinitions for quantum-safe communications.\nApart from technical harmonization, government control\nand policy support will be essential to create an environment fit\nfor the development of QFL software. While preserving robust\nprivacy protections and security guarantees, policies support-\ning public-private partnerships and investments in quantum\ntechnology R&D could speed innovation [149]. Regulatory\nauthorities may also specify compliance strategies for quantum\ndata privacy, thereby ensuring that QFL systems follow strict\nguidelines before being used in national defense, banking, and\ncrucial industries, including healthcare. Transparency in data\ngovernance and model update policies will assist authorities in\nreducing hazards and safeguarding user-sensitive data in major\nquantum installations [65].\nFurthermore, ensuring cross-border compatibility and ac-\ncelerating information flow is the establishment of interna-\ntionally accepted standards, probably through consortia such\nas the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers and\nthe International Organization for Standardization. This world-\nwide approach to control and standard-setting will be vital\nsince QFL development sometimes entails cooperation across\nseveral areas, each with its own legal systems. Ultimately,\nthe safe, secure, and scalable adoption of QFL depends on\nuniform standards and prudent government involvement so\nenabling different stakeholders to trust, invest in, and gain from\nquantum-enhanced FL systems [180].\nD. Integration with 6G Networks\nGiven the stringent requirements of 6G networks—such\nas ultra-low latency, massive connectivity, and high scala-\nbility—the integration of QFL into next-generation wireless\ninfrastructures offers significant technological promise along-\nside substantial challenges [186]. At its core, QFL relies on\ndistributed quantum or hybrid quantum-classical devices that\ncollaboratively train models while preserving data privacy and\nlocality. However, supporting such quantum workloads over\n6G environments demands robust architectural designs and\ncommunication protocols capable of jointly addressing the\nconstraints of both quantum and classical resources [181].\nEffective quantum-safe communication is required to meet\nultra-low latency and security requirements from end users.\nHowever, current quantum channels sometimes suffer from re-\nstricted range and decoherence. Reliable quantum state transfer\nwith minimum delay is challenging since it depends on quan-\ntum repeaters, error-correcting codes, or entanglement-assisted\nrouting to preserve coherence across large distances [182].\nMoreover, with 6G predicted to enable vast machine-type\ncommunication, scalability challenges are raised by large-scale\nQFL. The quantum hardware capabilities of every node differ;\nhence, maintaining safe consensus across several quantum\ndevices generates synchronization and scheduling complexity\nthat requires tailored quantum-aware aggregation techniques\n[183].\nGiven the high bandwidth consumption of quantum-based\nprotocols and the computational expense of error mitigation\nIEEE COMMUNICATIONS SURVEYS & TUTORIALS\nTable VII: Summary of Research Challenges, Solution, and Direction for QFL.\nChllenges\nDescription\nSolutions\nPossible direction\nSystem\nHeterogeneity\nin\nQFL\n• Devices differ in qubit count, im-\npacting the complexity and size of\nfeasible QML models.\n• Implement advanced integra-\ntion techniques to harmonize\nmodel updates across devices\nwith varying quantum circuit\ncomplexities [175].\n• Explore adaptive algorithms\nand federated transfer learn-\ning to enhance model com-\npatibility and learning effi-\nciency [173], [176].\nQuantum Noise Control in\nNISQ-based QFL\n• NISQ devices, characterized by\nlimited qubit counts and short co-\nherence periods, struggle with de-\ncoherence, gate errors, and mea-\nsurement inaccuracies.\n• Employ\nerror\nmitigation\ntechniques\nlike\nzero-\nnoise\nextrapolation\nand\nprobabilistic error canceling,\nthough they require multiple\ncircuit runs [177].\n• Develop\nnoise-aware\nQFL\nalgorithms\nthat\nadjust\nlearning\nparameters\nbased on real-time device\nperformance,\nand\nexplore\nhybrid\nerror-correcting\napproaches\nto\nenhance\nscalability and efficiency in\nQFL systems [173], [178].\nStandardization in QFL\n• As QFL moves towards real-world\napplication, establishing industry-\nwide standards for interoperability,\nsecurity, and reliability is crucial.\n• Develop global standards in-\ncluding performance criteria\nfor quantum circuits, data\nformats, and secure commu-\nnication protocols [179].\n• Foster international regula-\ntory cooperation and create\nsupportive policies for QFL\ninnovation, ensuring safe and\nefficient system deployment\nacross critical sectors [65],\n[149], [180].\nIntegration\nwith\n6G\nNet-\nworks\n• QFL must align with 6G’s ultra-\nlow latency, massive connectivity,\nand scalability through effective\nquantum-safe communications and\nresource management.\n• Implement\nadvanced\nquantum\nrepeaters,\nerror-\ncorrecting\ncodes,\nand\nnetwork slicing for efficient\nquantum state transfer and\nresource\nallocation\n[181],\n[182].\n• Develop hybrid networking\nsolutions that integrate quan-\ntum\nand\nclassical\nlayers,\nensuring seamless operation\nwithin 6G frameworks [183],\n[184].\non NISQ devices, resource management also becomes cru-\ncial.

Without sacrificing\nsecurity or performance, researchers have to create hybrid net-\nworking solutions that effortlessly combine quantum channels\nwith advanced 6G capabilities, including massive multiple-\ninput and multiple-output (MIMO) or terahertz communication\n[184]. From creating new quantum network topologies fit for\n6G to using standardized quantum-safe techniques, addressing\nthese problems calls for multidisciplinary efforts. Development\nin these fields will define whether low-latency, large-scale\nQFL installations in next-generation wireless environments are\nfeasible.
