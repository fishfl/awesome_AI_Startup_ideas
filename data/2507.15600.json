In this work, we show\nhow the analysis of conflicting narratives, i.e. conflicting interpretive lenses through which political reality is\nexperienced and told, provides insight into the discursive mechanisms of polarization and issue alignment in\nthe public sphere. Building upon previous work that has identified ideologically polarized issues in the German\nTwittersphere between 2021 and 2023, we analyze the discursive dimension of polarization by extracting textual\nsignals of conflicting narratives from tweets of opposing opinion groups. Focusing on a selection of salient issues\nand events (the war in Ukraine, Covid, climate change), we show evidence for conflicting narratives along two\ndimensions: (i) different attributions of actantial roles to the same set of actants (e.g. diverging interpretations of\nthe role of NATO in the war in Ukraine), and (ii) emplotment of different actants for the same event (e.g. Bill Gates\nin the right-leaning Covid narrative). Furthermore, we provide first evidence for patterns of narrative alignment,\na discursive strategy that political actors employ to align opinions across issues. These findings demonstrate the\nuse of narratives as an analytical lens into the discursive mechanisms of polarization.\n1\nIntroduction\nNarratives are key interpretive devices through which humans make sense of their environment (Bruner,\n1991; Polkinghorne, 1988). They serve as lenses through which reality is experienced and told. In political\nscience, narratives are described as meaning-making devices through which “people make sense of their\nlives” by “construct[ing] disparate facts and weav[ing] them together cognitively to make sense of reality”\n(Patterson and Monroe, 1998). This sense-making step is often achieved by reducing the complexity\nof complex political events and relationships into “easily understandable stories” (Groth, 2019). This\nreduction, which usually involves causal chaining of events and attributions of archetypical roles to\npolitical actors, such as protagonists or antagonists, allows the narrator to convey their political stance\nby selecting which events are included, which actors and relationships are highlighted and what role they\nplay. In political communication, this makes narratives powerful rhetorical devices that have been shown\nto affect beliefs and attitudes (Antinyan et al., 2024; Green and Brock, 2000).\nFurthermore, narratives can serve as ways to define one’s identity (Somers, 1994), and the identity of\na group by delimiting the “we” from an outside “they” (Hartley, 2015). These identities, often defined\nthrough antagonization of an out-group, could be at the origin of larger political divides. Next to identities,\nFriedman (2023) suggests that ideological polarization can be explained through the existence of diverging\ninterpretive frames through which the world is experienced. We argue that narratives are a powerful\nanalytical lens through which one can observe such diverging interpretive frames in text. This in turn\nprovides insight into the central fault lines along which ideologically opposing camps divide.\nOnly few studies have investigated the connection between polarization and narratives empirically. Jing\nand Ahn (2021) shed light on the role of diverging narratives in the context of the Covid debate on\nTwitter in the US by computationally analyzing narratives of Democrats and Republicans. They find that\n(i) narratives diverge in focus, Republicans focusing on outside actors such as China, while the Democrats\nfocus on health issues and financial support, and that (ii) both parties heavily antagonize each other in\n1\narXiv:2507.15600v1  [cs.CL]  21 Jul 2025\ntheir narrative. Still within the topic of Covid, Zhao et al. (2023) show that the Twitter discourse on\nCovid in the US has become more polarized and aligned with party preferences over time. This points to\nanother feature of narratives: the one of integrating disparate political events into pre-defined webs of\nmeaning, and potentially instrumentalizing issues such as a pandemic to further fortify one’s ideological\nviews through strategic emplotment. Directly related is the question whether such strategies are actually\nsuccessful in affecting opinions and beliefs. Antinyan et al. (2024) show in an experimental setting that\nselective exposure to different narratives about Covid may indeed affect participants’ beliefs about the\norigins of the pandemic.\nThe present paper goes beyond previous approaches by systematically analyzing the conflicting narratives\nof opposing opinion groups across several salient political topics. Drawing upon previous work that\nempirically provides structural evidence for polarization and issue alignment in the German Twittersphere\nbetween 2021 and 2023 (Pournaki et al., 2025), we systematically extract and analyze textual signals of\nnarratives (Pournaki and Willaert, 2024) of opposing ideological camps around the war in Ukraine, Covid\nand climate change in order to shed light on the following questions: What are the central discursive fault\nlines along which the left and right-leaning groups divide? What discursive strategies are employed in\norder to connect different issues such to facilitate the alignment of opinions? Approaching these questions\nusing a combination of distant and close reading, this work surfaces the discursive points of tension\nbetween the two groups and reveal larger metanarrative patterns that could be at the origin of the\nobserved issue alignment.\n2\nData\nThis work uses a dataset of tweets previously introduced in Pournaki et al. (2025). The dataset includes\ntweets on trending topics over the course of more than two years. More specifically, the authors collected\ntweets from 2021-03-29 to 2023-07-12 according to the following scheme: at the beginning of each day, a\nscript was launched that collects the current “trending topics” (from now on referred to as “trends”) in\nGermany using the Twitter Trend API (v1). By default, trends are personalized based on the account’s\nTwitter/X usage. One can, however, disable the personalization by setting a specific location from which\nto draw the trending topics, which then yields “popular topics among people in a specific geographic\nlocation” (X/Twitter, 2025). The script was re-run every 15 minutes. At the end of each day, the authors\ncounted the number of times each trending topic appeared during the day and kept the top 5 most\nfrequent ones. This provided a proxy of the five most important trending topics for that day. The Twitter\nSearch API (v1) was used to collect German-speaking tweets using the exact trend keyword as a query\non the day it trended and the day after (48hrs). Tweets were collected using a single Twitter API key,\ncollecting tweets for maximally 24 hours every day. Each collected trend is one sub-dataset. This results\nin 3007 trending topics collected. Trends were merged if the exact same phrase occurs within a time\nwindow of 1 day. After merging, there are 2693 sub-datasets. These contain a total of 19,105,532 tweets.\n3\nMethods\n3.1\nStructural analysis of polarization\nThe structural analysis of polarization on Twitter was previously presented in Pournaki et al. (2025) and\nis described in the upper two rows of Fig. 1. We summarize it very briefly here in order to contextualize\nthe present findings.\n3.1.1\nExtracting issues from tweets\nFirst, all tweets were processed through a BERTopic-based pipeline (Grootendorst, 2022) which allows\nto inductively surface the latent topics present in the text by clustering tweets in a semantic space given\n2\nFigure 1: Analysis pipeline. The raw text data of tweets is processed in a topic model to extract the main issues\ndiscussed, which is then used to assign an overall issue to each trend. In parallel, retweet networks are constructed\nand clustered to extract the opinions of users for each trend. From this set of partitions, the most prominent\nusers are extracted (influencers and multipliers) and a user alignment matrix is computed that quantifies how\nsystematically pairs of users appear in the same cluster across the dataset. Importing the issue labels from the\ntopic model analysis allows to compute the user alignment separately for each issue, which is then used to generate\nthe issue alignment matrix that measures how similarly two issues sort these users into opinion groups. The results\nfrom the structural analysis of retweet networks allows to divide the textual corpus into ideological clusters. After\nprocessing the tweets using the narrative pipeline described in Pournaki and Willaert (2024), we systematically\ncompare the actantial networks to uncover conflicting narratives for a selected range of salient topics (War in\nUkraine, Covid and climate change).\nby pre-trained sentence embedding models. The assumption is that clusters in that space correspond to\ntopic clusters. These topics were then manually grouped into larger issues, such as Covid (including topics\nsuch as vaccination, masks, school closures), or climate change (including topics such as activism, meat\nconsumption, ...). Each trend could then be assigned one of those larger issues, based on the majority of\ntweets it contains. Table A1 shows the issues extracted through this method and their prevalence across\nthe corpus.\n3.1.2\nExtracting opinions from tweets\nIn parallel, a retweet network was extracted from each trend, where nodes are Twitter accounts and a\ndirected link is drawn from account i to j if i retweets j. Since retweets are considered endorsement,\ndensely connected clusters in such networks correspond to opinion clusters in the underlying political\ndebate (Conover et al., 2011; Gaisbauer et al., 2021; Gaumont et al., 2018). Conceptually, a retweet\nnetwork with two clusters can therefore be treated as an opinion poll. A user can take either the stance\n´1 or 1 on a given issue spanned by a trending topic. An SBM-based approach (Peixoto, 2019) provides\nthe cluster assignment for each node in each network. This allows to measure, across the dataset, how\noften a given pair of users are in the same opinion cluster. Computing a measure of user alignment and\nclustering the resulting alignment matrix shows that the user base is largely divided into two camps: one\nleft-leaning and one right-leaning, which were identified by manually examining the most active users in\neach camp.\nThe global clustering into left/right is used in order to assign each tweet to one of the two camps, based\non the majority of retweets it recieved. This allows to generate, for each issue, two sub-corpora: one of\nleft-leaning and one of right-leaning tweets, that are analyzed separately for conflicting narrative signals.\n3\n3.2\nExtracting conflicting narratives\nIn order to analyze conflicting narratives of various topics in Twitter discussions, this work builds upon\nthe extraction of narrative signals developed in Pournaki and Willaert (2024). The central idea is that\nnarratives are co-created and often not explicitly stated in full in the text. Therefore, the challenge of\nextracting narratives from digital traces is to identify key narrative signals, in the form of actors, their\nrelationships, and their goals/motives. These signals are then reassembled into actantial networks, where\nnodes are actors, and links denote the nature of their relationship as conflictive, supportive, or neutral.\nThese networks are typically very large and contain information that is not necessary for the analysis of\npolitical narratives. To get insight into the most prominent narrative signals, the nodes in the networks\nare therefore filtered using centrality measures (in-/out-degree, betweenness). Finally, we recall that each\nedge in the network arises from a collection of textual passages in the original data1. Pointing precisely\nto these passages allows to contextualize each of those actantial links and add a hermeneutic layer to\nthe computational analysis. The approach therefore combines a fully inductive, machine-learning based\nextraction of narrative signals from raw text with an interpretive layer of close reading, which allows to\nreconstruct the underlying (meta-)narratives.\nIn practice, the approach consists in first transforming text into a structured representation using the\nsemantic parsing framework of Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) (Banarescu et al., 2013). This\nframework represents the meaning of sentences as directed acyclical graphs, where the root is the verb\nof the sentence, and the leaves are given by the arguments (e.g. subject/object). The corpus is therefore\nparsed into a set of AMR graphs, which are then transformed into a tabular representation, which can\neasily be queried for narrative signals, and from which actantial networks can be generated (we refer to\nthe reader to Pournaki and Willaert (2024) for a detailed description of the processing steps involved).\nSince the AMR parser in its current state does not handle German, we by translate our full corpus of\noriginal tweets into English using the transformer-based model mbart-large-50-many-to-many-mmt2,\nthat provides a good tradeoff between efficiency and accuracy (Tang et al., 2020). We then parsed the left\nand right-leaning subcorpora to analyze the systematic differences in narratives of the opposite camps\nacross topics, with respect to involved actors, their ascribed actions, as well as relationships in the form of\nactantial networks. A link from node i to j in the actantial network has a weight wpi, jq which denotes the\nnumber of times a relationship from i to j has been (re)tweeted in the corpus, and a score σpi, jq P r´1, 1s\nwhich denotes how supportive (« `1), conflictive (« ´1) or neutral (« 0) the relationship is. This score\nis computed based on all the individual interactions from i to j, which, in (Pournaki and Willaert, 2024)\nare classified using verb category dictionaries (Di Fabio et al., 2019).\nIn this work, we extend the narrative signal extraction to allow for the systematic extraction of conflicting\nnarratives, and to better fit the Twitter data at hand, by adding the following two processing steps:\n3.2.1\nLLM-assisted actantial link labeling\nIn the actantial network, each node is an actor and a directed, weighted, scored link is drawn from actor\ni to j where the weight is defined as the sum of retweets of all tweets in which the edge is contained, and\nthe score denotes whether the link is supportive (positive values), conflictive (negative values) or neutral\n(zero). In Pournaki and Willaert (2024), the approach to label a given relationship is based on a pre-\ndefined categorization of verb families using the VerbAtlas dictionary (Di Fabio et al., 2019), where each\nverb family was assigned one of the three categories3. This bears a number of limitations which mainly\nrevolve around the question of context, which potentially plays an important role in the determination of\nthe conflictive or supportive nature of the relationship. In the present setting, the context consists of the\nactors involved, and the preceding and following sentences in the tweet.\nWe identify Large Language Models (LLMs) as a potential tool to include this broader context into the\n1The sentence “Russia attacked Ukraine.” would, for instance, contribute to a conflictive link from Russia to Ukraine.\n2https://huggingface.co/facebook/mbart-large-50-many-to-many-mmt\n3The Verbatlas family attack_bomb, which contains verbs like “invade” would, for example, be labeled as conflictive.\n4\nanalysis. Previous work has shown their potential in text annotation tasks, and in particular that their\naccuracy can exceed the one of human annotators (Aldeen et al., 2023; Alizadeh et al., 2024; Bojić et al.,\n2025; Gilardi et al., 2023; Ziems et al., 2024), even though this depends on the domain (Lu et al., 2023;\nNasution and Onan, 2024). Aside from providing the full tweet as context to the LLM, this approach\nallows to use the original, German-speaking tweet for the inference of the relation type. This can mitigate\npotential mistakes in the translation that could have occurred at an earlier step of the pipeline.\nWe use the open weight model Phi-4 (Abdin et al., 2024), forcing the model to produce JSON output\nusing structured/guided generation (Willard and Louf, 2023), which highly facilitates further processing\nand makes the pipeline more efficient by decreasing inference time. We report the prompt in the Appendix\nA.2 and validate and assess the benefits and limitations of the LLM-based approach in the Appendix A.3.\n3.2.2\nSystematic extraction of conflicting narratives\nWe approach the extraction of conflicting narratives by systematically comparing links in actantial\nnetworks. Let GlpVl, Elq be the actantial network extracted from left-leaning tweets and GrpVr, Erq the\nactantial network extracted from right-leaning tweets. Take two edges e1 “ pi, j, wlpi, jq, σlpi, jqq P El\nand e2 “ pi, j, wrpi, jq, σrpi, jqq P Er, where w denotes the weight and σ P r´1, 1s denotes the edge\nscore. We assume conflicts between two narratives to surface when relationships between actors are\nnarrated in an opposite way (i.e. supportive in one narrative vs. conflictive in the other). Therefore, if\nsignpαlpi, jqq ‰ signpαrpi, jqq, we assume the underlying edge to correspond to a narrative trace that\npoints to a fault line in the underlying debate. Finally, we examine the actantial networks made of only\nthose links that point to potential conflicts. Paired with a close reading of relevant tweets associated to\nthose links, the approach allows to reconstruct the diverging lenses through which the two camps view\npolitical reality.\n4\nResults\nWe focus on a subset of prevalent issues during the data collection period, namely the war in Ukraine,\nCovid and climate change. The goal of this analysis is twofold: (i) discover the underlying conflicting\nnarratives that might explain the observed polarization, and (ii) discover the discursive mechanisms by\nwhich these different issues may be connected. Using the methodology described in 3.2, we start by\nanalyzing each of the three issues separately, and then move to a combined analysis that reveal first\nevidence of larger meta-narrative patterns.\nWe start by analyzing each of the three issues separately. We generate the subset of tweets of each\ncamp and extract the actantial networks. We start by apprehending identity narratives as out-going ego\nnetworks of the node we for both camps. Then, we extract conflict networks, subsets of the actantial\nnetworks that contain the most central actants (selected by ranking the nodes in the full actantial networks\nby in-degree/out-degree and betweenness centrality and keeping the relevant ones within the top 100),\nand that solely contain links that have an opposing score between the two camps. These conflict networks\nsurface the central fault lines in the polarized discussions.\nThese networks can be concieved as re-assembled narrative signals that, by themselves, provide a distant\noverview of the narrative content in the underlying textual corpus, and surface the discursive points\nof tension between the communities. To fully apprehend the underlying narratives, it is necessary to\ncomplement the network representations with a close reading approach of a subset of relevant tweets that\nled to the extracted links. In the following section, we demonstrate this guided close reading protocol:\nfirst, we extract the different types of narrative networks (ego networks of the nodes we and networks of\nmost important actors for both camps). Then, we contextualize the links by reading and interpreting the\n5 most retweeted tweets of each link (see Appendix for a selected list of close-read tweets). Finally, we\nsummarize the conflicting narratives for each of the three investigated issues, and provide first insights\ninto the common patterns observed across them that may explain the observed issue alignment.\n5\nwe_left\nattack\nEurope\nRussia\nUkraine\ndefense\ndelivery\ndemonstration\nfreedom\ngas\nNATO\npeace\nRussians\nUkrainians\nVladimir Putin\npipeline\nNord Stream 2\nsupplies\nsupport\ntank\nwar\nweapon\nwe_right\nUkraine\n-1\n0\n+1\nlink score\nFigure 2: Identity narrative network extracted from trends related to Russia’s aggression of Ukraine. Link width\nis proportional to weight, link color reflects the link score (red“conflictive, blue“supportive, grey“neutral, color\nbar only plotted here for subsequent actantial networks). Links reflect relationships retweeted at least 500 times.\n4.1\nWar in Ukraine\nOne central topic in the timerange we observed was the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Russia began\nincreasing its military presence near the border from March/April 2021, before launching the invasive\nattack on Ukraine’s territory on February 24 2022. This has since led to the deadliest war in Europe\nsince World War II, causing large numbers of military and civilian casualties and displacements. The\nwar is also fought on the level of (mis)information and narrative, which this section sheds light on by\nsystematically analyzing the narrative signals of left- and right-leaning Twitter communities.\n4.1.1\nIdentity narrative\nFigure 2 shows the merged ego-networks of the node we for the topic Ukraine. The links are filtered\nby the sum of the number of (re)tweets that contain the relationship: each edge needs to be retweeted\nat least 500 times. We see that certain nodes are only connected to either one of the we entities, while\ncertain nodes are connected to both. The former represent actants emplotted in relation to only one\nof the groups, while the latter represent actants to which relationships can be contested across the two\ngroups.\nExamining the network and close reading the most retweeted tweets associated to each edge allows\nus to reconstruct the narratives built around each of the collective identities (see Appendix A.4 for\nthe corresponding tweets). The left-leaning camp identifies itself through strong solidarity and support\nfor Ukraine (supportive links towards Ukrainians, support, defense), which implies delivering weapons to\nUkraine. Vladimir Putin is strongly condemned, the corresponding tweets show that he is explicitly blamed\nfor starting the war. Furthermore, we observe a conflictive stance towards demonstrations, which refer to\n6\nchildren\nlaw\nsupplies\nUkraine\nOlaf Scholz\nthe West\nEurope\narms\nRussia\npeace\nVladimir Putin\nwar\nUSA\nmedia\nNATO\nGermany\nPoland\nEURussians NS2 tank\nfreedom\nAfD\nleft\narms\npeace\nwar\nGermany\nRussia\ngas\nEurope\nVladimir Putin\nsupplies\nPoland\nUkraine\nUSA\nEU\nNS2 tank\nNATO\nchildren\nlaw\nthe West\nfreedom\nRussians\nlie\nmedia\nOlaf Scholz\nThe Green Party\nright\nUkraine\nFigure 3: Conflict networks extracted from trends related to Russia’s aggression of Ukraine. Each link has\nopposite sign in the left/right network.\n“demonstrations for peace” organized by groups with pro-Russian tendencies in Germany.\nTurning to the nodes connected to the right-leaning we, we observe supportive relationships to freedom\nand Nord Stream 2. Freedom is often evoked in right-wing narratives, and in the context of the Ukraine\nwar it is connected to freedom of action (not to enter the war with Russia), and freedom of expression\n(for non-interventionist voices promoting a pro-Russian narrative). We observe conflictive relationships\nto NATO and Europe, which are considered culprits in pushing Russia into an unavoidable defense war\n(described more explicitly in the following subsection).\nLooking at the contested nodes between the two camps, we observe that both parties exhibit a supportive\nrelationship to peace. The tweets connected to the link reveal different conceptions as to how to reach peace.\nOn the left, peace can only be reached by full support for Ukraine, while the right promotes the possibility\nof peace through non-intervention and reiterated phrases like “Weapons cannot bring peace.”. Looking\nat the connections to war, the left-leaning narrative exposes the shortcomings and lacking sanctions and\ndeals that allow to “finance Putin’s war” (hence the non-negative link). The right-leaning camp on the\nother hand strictly opposes Germany’s involvement in the war.\n4.1.2\nConflicting narratives\nFigure 3 shows the actantial network of central nodes in both left and right-leaning camps. Only links with\ndifferent sign of scores for left/right are drawn. This highlights the fundamental interpretive differences of\npolitical events between the two camps. While, on the left, the USA and NATO are trying to help Ukraine\nwho is being attacked by Russia, the right-leaning camp identifies them as the main culprits in this war.\nThis difference leads to other rifts, such as the divisive stance towards weapon supplies insinuated by\nthe difference in connecting weapons and peace: in the right-leaning cluster, weapons can never lead\nto peace, whereas the left-leaning cluster has a more nuanced stance and supports weapon supplies to\nprotect Ukraine’s sovereignty.\nFurthermore, we observe that both sides blame the ideological opponents, such as the media and the Green\nParty by the right, and the AfD by the left. In particular, the media is accused of lying and promoting\nanti-Russian propaganda in the right-leaning camp, while the left accuses Russia of silencing independent\nmedia. The role of Russia as a lawful state is contested as well: while the left-leaning camp emphasizes\nthat the attack is against international law, the right-leaning narrative suggests that Russia is merely\n7\nwe_left\ncases\ncause\nchildren\ndata\nfreedom\nimmunization\nincidence\ninfection\nlife\nlockdown\nmask\nmeasures\nobligation\npandemic\nvaccinated people\npopulation\nrestriction\nschool\ncovid test\nvaccination\nvaccine\nvirus\nwe_right\nside eﬀects\nright\nCovid\nFigure 4: Identity narrative network extracted from trends related to Covid. Link weight threshold 500.\n(lawfully) defending itself against the threat of Ukraine, USA and NATO.\nWe observe another example of conflicting interpretations of reality when we turn our attention to the\nlink from Vladimir Putin to children. In March 2023, the International Criminal Court arrested a warrant\nagainst Putin, claiming he is “responsible for the war crime of unlawful deportation of population (children)\nand that of unlawful transfer of population (children) from occupied areas of Ukraine to the Russian\nFederation” (ICC, 2023). This allegation is echoed in the left-leaning camp, while the right-leaning camp\nclaims that Putin saved those children from war zones, thus portraying him as a hero rather than a\ncriminal. This example shows how the same event can serve to narrate an actant’s position in opposite\nways, depending on which position fits the larger ideological narrative.\n4.2\nCovid\nWe now turn our attention to another central trending topic in the dataset: the Covid pandemic. The\nfirst trending hashtag in the dataset appears on 2021-03-30 (“#harterLockdownJetzt”) and the last on\n2023-06-17 (“Lauterbach”). Across the timerange, we find discussions around the various facets of the\npandemic, from counter-measures like lockdowns, schools closures, home office to prevention like masks,\ntesting and vaccination. These sparked polarized debates about individual freedom, trust in science and\nthe government.\n4.2.1\nIdentity narrative\nFigure 4 shows the identity narrative network around the Covid pandemic. We observe that the left-\nleaning cluster identifies itself through the positive stance towards measures to prevent virus spread. This\nincludes masks, tests, lockdowns, restrictions, and vaccinations. The right-leaning camp strongly opposes\nthese measures while referring to fundamental human rights and misguided, politicized science. There is\na focus, in the left-leaning narrative, on solidarity and compliance to fight the disease together, while\nthe right-leaning narrative focuses on individual freedom. These differences in narrative turn masks or\nvaccines into markers of ideological identity: wearing masks, getting vaccinated can act as signals of\nideological leaning.\n8\nschool\nchildren\nLong Covid\nfreedom\nlife\nmask\npandemic\ncovid test\nvaccination\nlockdown\nvaccine\ndoctor\ngovernment\nJens Spahn\nKarl Lauterbach\npolitician\nleft\nsafety\nchildren\nLong Covid\nfear\nBundestag\nmask\npandemic\nschool\nvaccination\nfreedom\nscience\ndoctor\ncovid test\nvaccine\nside eﬀects\npolitician\nvirus\nright\ngovernment\nKarl Lauterbach\nBill Gates\nright\nCovid\nFigure 5: Conflict networks extracted from trends related to Covid.\n4.2.2\nConflicting narratives\nFigure 5 shows the conflict networks for the Covid pandemic. We observe divergent views on the effective-\nness of the vaccination and its side-effects, and trust in science. The vaccine’s safety is seriously doubted\nin the right-leaning narrative, while it is considered a necessary solution to fight the pandemic on the\nleft. We observe the interpretation of masks and other measures as harmful attacks on fundamental rights.\nDifferent political actors are antagonized: on the left, Jens Spahn (minister of health from 2018 to 2021)\nfor his allegedly poor management of vaccine distribution, and on the right, Karl Lauterbach (minister of\nhealth 2021 to 2025) for his strong pro-vaccine stance and his alleged attacks on freedom and fundamental\nrights.\nLooking at children, we observe differences in what each camp considers harmful for them: the left-leaning\ncamp warns of “sacrificing” children by keeping schools open and increasing their chances of being infected,\nwhile the right-leaning camp warns of the potential psychological harms connected to masks and isolation.\nWe also observe certain actors that only play a role in the right-leaning narrative: for one, fear is being\nmongered by politicians in order to get the population to comply with the harsh measures. Then, science\nproves the importance of the vaccine’s side-effects, which are not discussed in the left-leaning camp.\nFinally, we find traces of the conspiracy theory around Bill Gates’ involvement in the orchestration of the\npandemic for personal profit, which does not exist in the left-leaning narrative.\nIn the right-leaning camp, we observe traces of a recurring general narrative about individual freedom:\nin this case, it is infringed upon by the political establishment through harsh measures. This theme also\nconnects Covid to the topic of climate change, as will become visible in the following section.\n4.3\nClimate change\nThe climate change topic is a multi-faceted issue in the dataset and spans trends from the beginning of the\ndata collection on 2021-03-29 to 2023-07-12. The related sub-topics are on one hand weather events such\nas the heavy floods in July 2021 (#Hochwasserkatastrophe, 2021-07-18), discussions about speed limits\non highways (Tempolimit, 2021-10-18), climate activism (#LetzteGeneration, 2023-05-26), the climate\nsummits (#COP27, 2022-11-10), and the town of Lützerath that was destroyed to build a coal mine and\nsparked large-scale demonstrations (#Luetzerath, 2023-01-14). The subsequent analysis shows that there\nare fundamental differences between the two camps as to how extreme weather events, as well as climate\nchange and climate activism, are interpreted and emplotted.\n9\nwe_left\ncar\nclimate catastrophe\nclimate change\nclimate\ncoal\nclimate crisis\ndestruction\nheat\nlimit\nmeat\nobligation\npolicy\npolitics\nprotection\nprotest\nCO2\nstate\nstorm\ntemperature\nclimate terrorists\nviolence\nwe_right\ninsect\nClimate Change\nFigure 6: Identity narrative network extracted from trends related to climate change. Link weight threshold 250.\n4.3.1\nIdentity narrative\nFigure 6 shows the identity narrative networks of climate change. One main difference between the left-\nleaning and the right-leaning camp arises from the interpretation of climate change as an actual threat.\nThis shows itself through the use of the word climate catastrophe. From this standpoint, the left-leaning\ncluster derives a negative stance towards coal, a positive stance towards speed and CO2 emission limits,\nand climate protests. On the right, the role of CO2 is relativized, and the emphasis is laid on the illegal\nactivities of climate terrorists. Furthermore, there is a focus on the consumption of meat, induced by\nthe fear that the supermarket chain Lidl announced an increase in plant-based products (the negative\nlink arises from sentences like “We will have to renounce meat”). Along similar lines, we find traces of\na conspiracy narrative around political elites forcing the regular population to eat insects while they\nthemselves eat steaks on their yachts. This echoes previously identified narratives around individual\nfreedom that is being infringed upon by political elites.\n4.3.2\nConflicting narratives\nFigure 7 shows the conflict networks of climate change. We observe a central difference between the two\ncamps with respect to the impact of climate change on society. While the left considers floods a direct\nconsequence of climate change, the right does not acknowledge this connection. Similarly, we observe\ndifferences in the evaluation of the dangers of coal.\nStaying within the right-leaning narrative, we observe that the Green Party and the fear-mongering media\nare antagonized, as in the war in Ukraine. Lidl is evoked in the right-wing narrative due to allegations\nthat the supermarket chain will reduce sales of meat products. Furthermore, one central interpretive\nconflict lies in the role Germany can play in the larger scheme of climate change: for the right, Germany\ncannot respond to stop climate change and should therefore focus on other issues, while the left believes\nin Germany’s responsibility to tackle the issue. This may lead to conflicting conceptions about the Last\n10\nclimate\nclimate crisis\nlimit\nclimate activist\nauthority\nﬂood\nprotection\nclimate change\nfreedom\nCO2\ncoal\nRWE\ngovernment\npolitics\nLützerath\nGermany\nLast Generation\nright\nArmin Laschet\nFDP\nThe Green Party\nstateviolence\nman\npolitician\nleft\nauthority\nﬂood\nclimate change\nGermany\nwater disaster\nclimate\nLidl\nmeat\nCO2\nLast Generation\nprotection\ndemocracy\nman\nmedia\nThe Green Party\nright\nClimate Change\nFigure 7: Conflict networks extracted from trends related to climate change.\nGeneration and climate activists. On the right, their actions are heavily condemned as illegal and anti-\ndemocractic, while the left supports their efforts. Finally, we note that climate change is not a pressing\nissue for the right, while the left is convinced that it is one of the central issues that need to be tackled.\nThe analysis of conflicting narratives for each of the three issues revealed the central fault lines along\nwhich the debates are polarized. While these fault lines are usually topic-specific, such as the diverging\ninterpretations of NATO’s role in the war in Ukraine, the guided close reading analysis surfaced some\nelements common to all three issues, such as antagonizations of the media in the right-leaning cluster.\nThe next section shall provide a first approach to analyze the narrative elements that are used to bind\nissues together and that may be at the origin of the observed issue alignment.\n4.4\nIssue alignment\nWe use the insights gained from the analysis of individual issues to generate first hypotheses about the\nrole of narratives for issue alignment. One way in which observe issues to be aligned are through the\ninvokation of recurring actors as protagonists or antagonists. Focusing on the connection between climate\nchange and Covid, we find that the left-leaning camp systematically holds up their trust in science:\n“Why does politics not listen to science?? #Laschet #Hochwater disaster #Climate disaster #Climate\ncrisis” (2021-07-16 09, 79 retweets)\n“I’ve been vaccinated 4 times, I’ve vaccinated over 3,000 patients in my clinic, I’ve set up a fever ambulance\nand I’m doing social media education. #DasHabeIchGetan I want politics to listen to science and provide\nme with vaccines. I don’t play golf. « NatalieGrams: Uncle brings me an idea. So write down under\n#DasHabeIchGetan what you’ve done to slow down the pandemic. Maybe politics will finally understand\nwhat it has to do! — »” (2021-11-28 18, 136 retweets)\n““Politics must finally learn to face science on an eye-to-eye basis.” — Christian Althaus, Bernese epidemi-\nologist, after leaving the Corona Taskforce of the Federal Government.” (2021-04-05 08, 74 retweets)\nOn the right, we observe that (mainstream) science is discredited:\n“What if politics and science are on the same side of climate change as Corona?” (2023-05-20, 621\nretweets)\nWe also observe signals of recurring narratives around fear and freedom that connect issues together. This\nleads to analogies between the government’s approach to Covid and climate change policy, as exemplified\n11\nthrough the emerging keyphrase “climate lockdown”, a powerful rhetorical tool that binds the issues\ntogether:\n“Please tell me that the people are not so submissive again and would accept a climate lockdown?!”\n(2023-06-16 07, 215 retweets)\n“Are you already looking forward to the CO2 lockdown and the QR code on your phone, without which\nyou will never be able to go anywhere? #Lanz #RicardaLang @ZDF #GreenGarbage” (2023-05-18, 555\nretweets)\nOn both camps, we observe the antagonization of ideologically opposite political parties. On the left, the\nAfD is constantly evoked as a threat to Germany, while on the right, the Green Party (often mentioned as\nthe “prohibition party”, highlighting their politics as a threat to individual freedom) plays that role as the\ncentral antagonist. This is exemplified through the villanization of the Green politician Karl Lauterbach\nas a central antagonist in several topics:\n“The stupid Karl #Lauterbach announces a heat protection plan, although much more people die in cold\nthan in heat. Therefore, a cold protection plan would make more sense: #Open Nordstream2 and #Restart\nnuclear power plants.” (2023-06-13 23, 151 retweets)\nFurthermore, we observe the general distrust in media in both topics:\n“Fact: During #Corona, we were deceived, framed by the media, trumpeted by purchased experts... Other\nopinions (which were the right ones) were suppressed, made impossible, shamed... EXACTLY THE SAME\ntakes place again on the topic of #Climate Change! #Berlin2030” (2023-03-25 18, 335 retweets)\n“Here speaks a courageous nurse from New Zealand. ‘No one listens to us and the media doesn’t listen\nto us either. They say we would complain of misinformation. We see vaccine damage every day. People\ncontact us all the time because of their vaccine damage.’” (2022-06-14 15, 243 retweets)\nFinally, we observe examples in which a larger number of issues are explicitly aligned:\n“Never thought how fast people swallow absurdities like \"weapons create peace\". But clearly, mask was\nalso freedom #b2502 #peace #Corona #propaganda” (2023-02-25, 1350 retweets)\n“There are no women with penises. Climate change is not man-made. Unregulated migration is destroying\nour social system and endangering our everyday lives. Corona is an average disease. Vaccination is ineffective\nbut not without side effects. With 70% in taxes and levies, the state is taking almost all of the income\nfrom working people. Ukraine is not defending us or our “values”. Every now and then such banal truths\nhave to be spoken in the face of the flood of disinformation.” (2023-05-10, 1646 retweets)\n“How did people actually survive in the past, when there were no smart-ass recommendations for meat\nconsumption, Karl Lauterbach wasn’t panicking about the heat, nobody was constantly talking about CO2\nand people were still allowed to decide for themselves which heating systems to install and which cars to\nbuy?” (2023-07-09, 129 retweets)\nThese examples allow to generate hypotheses about certain meta-narratives that may guide the ideological\nnarratives of the two camps. On the right, we observe a strong emphasis on individual freedom and\nreluctance to governmental interference. Furthermore, the skeptical narrative of the “lying media” and\n“fear-mongering politicians” transcends topical boundaries. On the left, we observe a recurring theme of\nsolidarity and shared responsobility – with the Ukrainian people, risk groups in Covid, the protesters in\nLützerath – that may serve as a larger ideological meta-narrative.\nThese observations are a first approach at using the narrative lens to study how issues are aligned through\nemplotment. In the examples shown for the war in Ukraine, Covid and climate change, we observe a\ncombination of repeatedly antagonized actors and direct analogies that may serve as strategies to align\nissues discursively and bundle them into coherent ideological sets.\n12\n5\nDiscussion\nThe present work has analyzed the discursive dimension of polarized debates through the lens of conflicting\nnarratives. On a large dataset of tweets (approx. 20M) from trending topics in Germany between 2021 and\n2023, where previous structural analyses have revealed strong polarization and issue alignment (Pournaki\net al., 2025), this work investigates the discursive dimension by extracting the conflicting narratives of\nopposing opinion groups. Focusing on three strongly salient topics (the Russian invasion of Ukraine,\nthe Covid pandemic and climate change), it demonstrated – using the guided close reading method of\nextracting and reassembling narrative signals developed in (Pournaki and Willaert, 2024) – how opposing\nopinion groups diverge in their interpretations of the same political events and issues. In particular, two\nways in which narratives about the same political issue can be conflicting were identified: (i) they can\ninvoke the same actors, but attribute different relationships to them, or, (ii) they can invoke different\nactors altogether, showing a divergence in the attribution of actantial importance within topics.\nThe first type of conflicting narrative is the one we largely observe in the case of the Russian invasion\nof Ukraine. The central actors (e.g. Ukraine, Russia, Germany, the USA, NATO, weapon supplies) are\npresent in both narratives, but the role, in particular of NATO and the USA are diametrically opposite.\nWhile these actors want to stop the war in the left-leaning narrative, they are fueling it in the right-leaning\nnarrative. Similarly, the elemental connection between human activity and climate change is disputed\nbetween the two sides in the issue of climate change.\nThe second type of conflicting narratives, the omission and highlighting of different actors, can be also\nobserved across the analyzed issues. In the narrative of Russia’s invasion, the right invokes the actor\nNord Stream 2, which is barely mentioned on the left. Similarly, vaccination side effects play a small\nrole in the left-leaning narrative on the Covid pandemic, as does Bill Gates. Looking at the narratives\non climate change, speed limits and the events in Lützerath play a marginal role in the right-leaning\nnarrative, which instead focuses on alleged threats by the supermarket chain Lidl to the personal freedom\nto eat meat. These findings echo a central feature of political narratives: only elements that serve the\npurpose of “fram[ing] [one’s own] political positions as favorable” (Groth, 2019) are emplotted.\nAnalyzing the common narrative signals across the three topics, we find first evidence for the potential\nrelationship between narratives and issue alignment. We observe a recurrence of certain antagonized\nactors and analogous relationships across the three topics we investigated (e.g. threats to Germany by\ncertain political parties, threats to individual freedom by policies...). Connecting these findings to previous\nliterature, we recall recent work by Lejano and Nero (2020) analyze the narratives of climate change\nskeptics, where they observe a meta-narrative around the loss of individual freedom through climate\npolicies. This is in line with the findings in our work, where we observe this pattern in the right-leaning\ncamp for the topic of Covid (through measures) and Ukraine (Germans not being free to choose to\nintervene or not in the war). On the left, we observe signs of a meta-narrative around solidarity and\nshared responsibility that connects the three observed topics (solidarity with Ukrainian people, Covid\nrisk groups, climate activists).\nWhat remains to be investigated more thoroughly is how to model such broader meta-narrative patterns,\nthus allowing for a systematic analysis across a wider range of topics present in our dataset (see Tab. A1\nfor all the topics present in the corpus). Such models could potentially build on structuralist approaches\nsuch as the one by Greimas (1973/1987) that would encompass the notion of “genetic metanarratives”\nhypothesized by Lejano and Nero (2020). Comparing climate skeptical narratives with anti-immigration\nnarratives, the authors find the recurring pattern of an outside actor (“the eco-terrorist”, “the foreigner”)\nthreatening to transform a desired “traditional way of life”. Further developing methods for the detection\nof existing, and the discovery of new such patterns can provide additional insights into the role of narrative\nin ideological polarization and issue alignment.\nAside from the potential for more comprehensive conceptual and computational models for metanarratives,\nthe present work has limitations that call for future work. Firstly, the analysis of conflicting narrative\n13\nnetworks assumes an internal coherence of narratives within the opinion groups. This must not necessarily\nbe the case, especially for topics like the war in Ukraine, which has shown to divide the German Left party.\nFurthermore, we recall here that we only investigated the links for which the communities’ narratives\ndiffered – looking at those parts of the narratives that are similar could provide a potential for mediation\nacross camps. Additionally, narratives usually evolve over time, an aspect also left unconsidered so far.\nIn future work, actantial networks can be analyzed over time to detect narrative shifts, for example\nthrough changes in link scores, or the introduction of new actors to the plot. This would allow deeper\nempirical insights into “how narrative truth is fabricated, how the validity of narratives is constructed\nor deconstructed, and how diffferent modes of reception influences the felicity conditions of political\nnarratives.” (Groth, 2019).\nReflecting on the general appropriateness of actantial networks as representations of narratives, we may\nquestion whether the relationships they encode (supportive/conflictive/neutral) are complex enough to\ncapture the potential nuances present in ideological narratives. While the full spectrum of verb actions (for\ninstance, given by Verbatlas) is too extensive, there may be an intermediary level of verb categorization\nthat could be envisaged in future work.\nFurthermore, additional work shall be done investigating the construction of in-group identities. This\nwork has provided first steps towards this analysis by investigating nodes connected to a common “we”.\nWe identify several natural avenues of improvement: firstly, the pronoun “we” can be decomposed into its\ndifferent deictic facets (inclusive, exclusive, general). Secondly, the extraction and labeling of actantial\nlinks can be sharpened by adding the dimension of the speaker: is the speaker part of the “we” that is\nevoked? This distinction would improve the direct interpretability of the actantial networks. Furthermore,\nmore thorough analysis needs to be conducted to analyze the systematic antagonization of the out-group.\nWhile investigating the actantial ego network of the pronoun “they” could be a first approach, this would\nrequire to be complemented with coreference resolution to remove textual traces that do not correspond\nto out-group descriptions.\nReflecting on the representativity of the findings, we highlight that the present work has focused the\nanalysis on one social media platform, Twitter/X, in a single country, Germany. Future work shall extend\nto different social media platforms and traditional media, as well as include different countries. The\nmathematical object of the actantial network lends itself to a systematic analysis of narrative diffusion\nthrough measures of graph similarity, which can yield insights into the role of different platforms and\nmedia sources play in distributing or influencing leading narratives around different issues.\nTo conclude, the observations presented in this work provide empirical descriptions of previously mentioned\nfunctions of narratives in conveying a political agenda (Groth, 2019; Hartley, 2015). By providing a\nlens through which political reality is interpreted, they reduce the complexity of political crises like\nwar, pandemics, or climate change, by selecting specific events and actors to highlight, and assigning\nantagonist/protagonist roles to them. These findings suggest further evidence for the manifestation of an\n“epistemological crisis” postulated by Friedman (2023), where opposing groups diverge with respect to\ntheir interpretation of political reality. If both groups assume that their narrative is a “true” representation\nof reality, this can only lead to mistrust and antagonization of the out-group. This work presented first\nattempts to empirically address these questions by providing a description of these diverging interpretive\nlenses in the form of conflicting narratives.\nAcknowledgements\nThe author thanks Eckehard Olbrich for fruitful discussions.

In the following tweet, the author expresses a relation from \"{A1}\" to \"{A2}\".\nProvide a description of the relation in English in max. 3 words. Determine whether the relation is supportive,\nconflictive or neutral for \"{A2}\".\nDefinition of relation types:\nSupportive relations include relations where \"{A1}\" approves of, causes, cares for, contributes to, helps, approves\nof, or creates \"{A2}\".\nConflictive relations include relations where \"{A1}\" disapproves of, attacks, betrays, prevents or reduces \"{A2}\".\nA neutral relation applies when the connection is only evoked in reported or direct speech, or when the implied\nrelation is neither supportive nor conflictive.\nDo NOT determine the relation type based on general knowledge — only use what is stated in the sentence.\nTWEET: {tweet}\n17\nA.3\nValidation of actantial link labeling\nWe selected 100 tweets, along with the ARG0 and ARG1 actants extracted using the AMR approach,\nand hand-coded the implied relationship (supportive/conflictive/neutral) manually. We observed cases\nwhich are difficult to address, in particular because they raise the question of necessary context. Consider\nthe following example, where the aim is to code the nature of the relationship between I and masks:\n“Well, I will continue to wear masks.”\nAs a human annotator, we are inclined to infer a supportive relationship for masks in general, since the\nact of wearing them, during the pandemic, symbolizes support for the measure. The LLM’s response is\nneutral, with the following explanation:\nThe statement implies that the author will continue to wear masks. The relation between ’I’ and ’masks’\nis neutral because the action of wearing does not inherently express approval or disapproval; it simply\nstates a personal intention without additional context.\nThis explanation leads us to agree with the output of the LLM, since there are indeed no explicit textual\ncues that imply a strong support.\nThere are clear cases, however, where the LLM fails to extract the correct relation type, in particular\nwhen the input text contains irony or sarcasm. This is something that could likely be mitigated with the\nincreasing ability of future models. Consider the following tweet as an example, where we want to extract\nthe relationship between “we” and “Armin Laschet”:\n“Yes, the streets are flooded; yes, these are extreme weather situations, but they have always existed! Just\nread the Bible. We have to elect Armin Laschet now, because only he can build us an ark! #HeavyRain\n#LaschetWave”\nThe LLM extracts a supportive stance since the tweet seems to praise Armin Laschet, while the expert\nhuman (especially knowing the political context) can infer the irony and detect the conflictive stance.\nWe compare the result from the LLM annotation to what we would get if we used a dictionary-based verb\nclassification previously introduced in Pournaki and Willaert (2024) that we refer to here as a context-free\ndictionary approach (CFD). We report an agreement with the human annotation on the sample of 100\ntweets that is significantly higher than the agreement with the CFD: the AMR+CFD approach yields\nan agreement of 46% with the human annotation, while the AMR+LLM approach yields an agreement\nof 86%. The low agreement with CFD may stem from different sources that warrant closer inspection.\nFor one, the translation step from German to English could introduce discrepancies and erase linguistic\nnuances that are captured by the LLM through the possibility of processing the original text. Furthermore,\nthe possibility to use the context, such as additional (sub-)sentences, instead of the verb alone, most\nlikely leads to better predictions. However, we highlight that the output of the AMR-based extraction of\nactors, which is fed to the LLM, is robust, even considering the translation. While additional validation\nand more thorough testing of various models is necessary, these preliminary insights expose the value of\na hybrid approach combining AMR-based relation extraction with LLM-based relation labeling.\nA.4\nClose reading examples\nIn this section, we report a selection of translated tweets that were close-read based on the actantial\nnetworks in order to reconstruct the conflicting narratives described in Sec. 4.\nA.4.1\nWar in Ukraine\nIdentity network\nWe see that the left-leaning camp is strongly supportive of Ukrainians, the defense and support for Ukraine:\n18\n“On the way to #Ukraine. Today in Kiev and tomorrow in Moscow, I will continue our talks on the\ncontinuing very serious situation on the border of Ukraine. In Kiev, it is important for me to express our\ncontinued solidarity and support to Ukraine. (1/2)” (2022-02-14, 327 retweets)\n“We are thinking about the people in #Ukraine. And those who are now on the run. We are looking\nfor people who can translate pressing health information. It is about being able to give refugees timely\ninformation in their hands. Thank you! Please RT.” (2022-02-28, 491 retweets)\nThe (Russian) attack is condemned, as well as demonstrations, which refers to the “demonstrations for\npeace”:\n“Maybe we could agree to stop talking about a \"peace demonstration\" today? #b2502 #StandWithUkraine”\n(2023-02-25, 568 retweets)\n“The mass graves in #Lyman leave you behind speechless. 340 people were hidden anonymously by the\n#invasion troops - including 60 children. The #Ukraine has now properly buried them and is trying to\nclarify the identities via DNA. Let’s stop #Putin.” (2023-01-07, 558 retweets)\n“We should not only condemn the Russian air attacks on peaceful Ukrainian cities, civilians and infras-\ntructure, but also speed up delivery of air defence and now deliver the weapons that have not yet been\ndelivered - firearms and combat tanks.” (2022-10-10, 486 retweets)\nTurning to the nodes specific to the right-leaning we, we observe a supportive relation towards freedom\nand Nord Stream2:\n“\"They can and should play an important role as honest brokers. The prerequisite is that we draw the\nright consequences and rebuild lost trust, sovereignty and freedom of action,\" says Alice #Weidel to the\n#Attack War on Ukraine. #Bundestag” (2022-02-27, 433 retweets)\n“We should not do what the perpetrators want & forget NordStream 1 & 2. On the contrary. What we\nshould demand is the immediate repair & the restarting of the two pipelines. Right now. Everything else\nwould be in the sense of the perpetrators & would harm us massively.” (2022-09-28, 762 retweets)\nThe NATO and Europe are antagonized:\n“Zelensky: “The US will have to send their sons and daughters just as we send our sons and daughters to\nwar. And they will have to fight because we are talking about NATO, and they will die.”” (2023-03-01,\n1194 retweets)\n“We should not leave Europe to the ’Leyens’.”4 (2022-09-16, 287 retweets)\nMoving to the nodes that are connected to both camps shows actors on which the stances differ. Looking\nat gas, the right-leaning camp is denouncing a double standard connected to stopping the gas sales with\nRussia:\n“We do not want gas from Russia because they launched an \"attack war\" against Ukraine. Instead, we are\nnow buying gas from Azerbaijan. They just launched an attack war against Armenia. The right attitude\nis so important.” (2022-09-13, 634 retweets)\n“Gabor Steingart at #Maischberger: We have paid off the gas ourselves with the sanctions against Russia.\nThis is an economic war against our own (German) population, which we cannot finance. I agree! Who\nelse?” (2022-09-20, 611 retweets)\nOn the left side, the issue of gas is connected to Russia not meeting contracts:\n“Once again for stupid: We don’t get gas because #Russia doesn’t meet its contracts! It doesn’t matter\nhow many pipelines don’t get gas. #NordStream2” (2022-09-27, 729 retweets)\n4This is a play on words. The German word “Laie” means “amateur”, the tweet implies that Ursula von der Leyen is an\namateur unit to lead the European Union.\n19\nFurthermore, we observe that the stance towards weapon supplies is different on the left and the right.\nThe right side is vocally against the supply of weapons:\n“It is precisely this point that worries me: if we deliver weapons - what happens to them later? No one can\ncheck where they are and, unfortunately, in Afghanistan we see that things can go wrong...” (2022-06-03,\n724 retweets)\n“As an opposition they promised: \"No weapons in war zones!\" As a government: \"We need weapons only\nin war zones.\" As an opposition they said: \"Climate has priority! Quit fossil energies!\" As a government:\n\"We urgently need coal.\" Greens even deceive the climate.” (2023-01-24, 540 retweets)\nOn the left side, there is a positive stance towards weapon supplies:\n“Russia is waging its war of destruction from a safe distance. Where is our answer? By refusing Ukraine\nextensive weapons, fighters + tanks, we are forcing it into an asymmetric war. That is politically, militaryly\nand morally wrong. « Gerashchenko_en: A woman curses Russians. It seems she lost her son in the attack.\nHer pain is unbelievable. Please watch the video till the end (I know it’s not the easiest one to watch).\nLook at the scale of destruction. And look at the number of people helping. — »” (2023-01-14, 325\nretweets)\n“Germany must stop hiding behind the USA. We have tanks & can deliver. We must finally do so now,\nso that this brutal war that is taking place in our neighbourhood ends as quickly as possible. #Ukraine”\n(2022-09-12, 674 retweets)\nAs for war and peace, there are conflicting stances as well. The left is not calling for an entering of\nGermany into the war, but for support of Ukraine:\n“Russia is threatening to dry up Nord Stream 1. The European response can only be: it should. If, for\ngood reasons, we are not prepared to intervene directly in the war, then at least we must be prepared to\nsacrifice part of our prosperity.” (2022-03-07, 658 retweets)\n“If Ukraine stops fighting, Ukraine ends. If Russia stops fighting, this war ends. And that is why we support\nUkraine, because we want this war to end. And because we want real peace. #StandWithUkraine” (2023-\n02-24, 373 retweets)\n“The bravery of the Ukrainians must be saluted. Every day we must examine whether we can do more to\nhelp them in this war. #Ukraine must win this war. CL” (2022-09-12, 276 retweets)\nThe right, on the other side, calls for peace by not escalating the war and letting it run its course:\n“#Muetzenich is right: #StrackZimmermann & others are irresponsibly leading us into direct war par-\nticipation. Anyone who demands delivery of heavy #combat tanks today will call for aircraft or troops\ntomorrow.” (2023-01-22, 1652 retweets)\n“We all don’t want a war! Stop agitating against Russians! Let’s not get back into a useless war that only\nbenefits the powerful! The media lie to us, the politicians lie to us, listen to your heart!” (2022-03-02, 519\nretweets)\n“No, damn it. For #Ukraine neither arms should be supplied nor soldiers sacrificed. As Helmut Schmidt\nsaid, “It’s not our business.” Would the Ukrainians fight for Germany? No! We should not participate in\nwar for this corrupt country.” (2022-02-27, 389 retweets)\nConflict network\nThere is a conflictive link from Ukraine to Europe on the right camp:\n“The United States has been preparing Ukraine for this war for 8 years in order to destroy Europe\neconomically, financially and militarily through the back door. We are celebrating our own demise because\nsomeone has called \"Putin is evil\".” (2022-05-14, 324 retweets)\nWe observe traces of antagonization on both sides. On the left side, the AfD is detrimental for Germany:\n20\n“The AfD is so “patriotic” that it would donate Germany for a knob to Putin.” (2022-03-02, 565 retweets)\nwhile the Green Party are the main antagonist harming Germany on the right:\n“2 years ago a lot of people still laughed about this action! Today, the ‘Ampel’ is not 2 years in office,\nnobody laughs anymore. At record speed the country is ruined and society is divided and inflamed against\neach other! The Greens are the biggest danger for Germany!” (2023-02-28, 491 retweets)\nA central conflict is attached to the role attributed to NATO and the USA in the war in Ukraine. On the\nleft side, the USA and NATO are helping Ukraine and are trying to end the war:\n“Have #Wagenknecht/s “justification” with the alleged statement of the #Rand Corporation advised\nthem to #start negotiations urgently because the #Ukrainian war could not be won reviewed because\nit didn’t seem plausible to me. Result: #FakeNews (see sources in the... « SandraNavidi: Does anyone\nactually review #Wagenknecht’s claims? Rand: It will be important for America to persevere in supporting\nUkraine for the long haul ... Stability in Europe is a vital US national security interest that may be served\nbest thru stopping #Putin — »” (2023-02-21, 188 retweets)\n“The perhaps most important political visit in the history of the independent Ukraine. Joe Biden surprised\n& impressed the Ukrainians with it. His message: The USA will support Ukraine as long as necessary.\nArrangements for the @Dayshow.” (2023-02-20, 108 retweets)\nOn the right side, the USA and NATO are profiting from the war and don’t want the it to stop:\n“Putin had offered the Americans to negotiate with Russia on the status of Ukraine. Joe Biden could have\neasily prevented this war. But the US wanted this war and have rejected Putin, at the expense of Ukraine\nand Europe.” (2022-09-04, 808 retweets)\n“What is your opinion? Has the @USkraine deliberately rocketed Poland in order to provoke the total war\nbetween NATO and Russia with a #FalseFlag action?” (2022-11-17, 114 retweets)\n“#NATO expansion to the east contradicted Western promises in the 1990s. In order to prevent escalation\nof the conflict in #Ukraine, Russian security interests must also be taken into account & a NATO accession\nof Ukraine must be excluded. #AnneWill” (2022-02-21, 581 retweets)\nWe see an interesting reversal of situations between media and Russia. On the left side, Russia is being\naccused of manipulating the media:\n“The Russian strategy: to turn off the free media quickly, then to turn on their own propaganda and thus\ntake control. That way then to organize \"elections\" and use a pro-Russian government. Like in Crimea.”\n(2022-03-01, 197 retweets)\nwhile on the right, the media is against Russia:\n“1/2 The kerosene lie: Currently, the media is spreading the lie that M1 Abrams needs kerosene, so it is\nnot suitable for that because of supply problems. His gas turbine can use EVERY burning liquid as fuel in\nany mixture:” (2023-01-21, 111 retweets)\nOn the right, the USA are allegedly attacking Nord Stream2:\n“The #USA torpedoes #NordStream2. At the same time, #Russia becomes the third largest oil supplier\nfor the US itself – thanks to sanctions.” (2022-02-23, 382 retweets)\nAn interesting distinction is also observed between the left and the right with respect to freedom, an actant\ntypically invoked within the right-leaning narrative. On the left, Ukraine is defending “our” freedom:\n“Since 1989/90, German politics has hardly changed as fundamentally as it does today. It was time.\n#Ukraine is now defending our freedom as well.” (2022-02-26, 17 retweets)\nWhile the right claims that this is not “our” freedom that is being defended:\n21\n“Friedrich Merz claims that Ukraine also defends \"our freedom\". What’s with these lies? No German has\nasked Ukraine to fight for him. We should not be talked into a war that is not ours! #DasIstNichtMeinKrieg”\n(2022-05-08, 357 retweets)\nA central allegation that separates the left and the right is whether and under what conditions Ukraine\nseeks peace. The left is clear that peace can only be had if Ukraine remains sovereign:\n“It is a strawman argument, because – of course wanting peace is per se good. Ukraine would also like\npeace - AND wants to continue to exist. The latter will be taken away from it if it subjugates to Russia.”\n(2023-02-11, 24 retweets)\nThe right-leaning narrative on that issue is not that clear and insinuates that Ukraine is not that interested\nin peace, but rather profits off of other countries:\n“Billions of euros go to other countries. With billions we are supporting the Ukraine war and the refugees\nenjoy in Germany \"all inclusive\" holidays. Now the Green leader said that the kindergarten standards are\nno longer financable. Future group size now with 30 children” (2022-09-13, 67 retweets)\n“The #Ukraine demands to join the war, joining NATO and the EU, and money. Freely available money.\nWhy does Ukraine not actually demand peace?” (2022-02-27, 12 retweets)\nThere is a different evaluation of Vladimir Putin and children. On the left, the ICC court order is reported:\n“The International Criminal Court has issued arrest warrants against Putin for the illegal deportation of\nchildren from #Ukraine to Russia. Now #Putin can no longer travel freely without having to fear being\narrested. Important sign of solidarity #PIRATEN” (2023-03-17, 37 retweets)\nOn the right, he is considered a hero for saving children from war zones:\n“\"The Internal Criminal Court, which the #US does not recognize, has issued a #warrant against #Putin\nfor having #evacuated #children from a #war zone that is being bombarded with #US weapons, which\nhave killed over 20 million people in 37 countries since the Second World War...” (2023-03-18, 525 retweets)\nFinally, there is the strong mismatch between the left and the right with respect to the role of weapon\nsupplies to end the war: while the left claims that the supply needs to be made to end it, the right claims\nthat the supply will just escalate the war.\n“\"Weapons prolong the war\" often comes as an argument from self-explained pacifists. The opposite is\nthe case. How many more cities could have been liberated if Ukraine had already received combat and\nartillery tanks - also from Germany - in the summer?” (2023-01-23, 80 retweets)\nOn the right, we see an example that leads us to the next issue:\n“Never thought how fast people swallow absurdities like \"weapons create peace\". But clearly, mask was\nalso freedom #b2502 #peace #Corona #propaganda” (2023-02-25, 1350 retweets)\nA.4.2\nCovid\nIdentity narrative\nWe observe different stances on testing:\n“For people who visit relatives in hospital or care, for example, or even care for relatives, we must offer\nreliable free tests for COVID. Christmas time must not be a risk for these people.” (2022-11-22, 151\nretweets, left cluster)\n“Our government boycotts the constitution. We boycott the tests #Testboycott” (2021-08-10, 61 retweets,\nright cluster)\n22\nLooking at the nodes that are uniquely connected to one or the other camp, we find that the right is\nfocused on side effects, freedom. Here we highlight another actor, which is data.\n“So one wonders: Why don’t we have these data in Germany? [link to article claiming that 80% of Covid\ndeaths are not due to Covid but other diseases]” (2021-08-31, 349 retweets)\nOn the left, one is concerned with protecting the population, and protecting children by keeping schools\nclosed:\n“This video is worth seeing. It shows correctly why the concerns of the vaccinators are unfounded. Why\nthe video did not exist before does not matter. We are moving forward towards protecting the population.”\n(2021-12-19, 1634 retweets)\n“Early 2020: If we only had the fastest & a vaccination, then we could end the pandemic Early 2021 (fastest\n& several vaccines available): Oh, let’s just run it & check young age groups & children #SARSCoV2\n#COVID19 #YesToNoCovid” (2021-04-12, 974 retweets)\n““The first thing we need to do is to open the schools.” Of course, the first thing I am going to do is\nto open the places that are worst protected, where about 10 million people come together for very long\nperiods of time, most of whom are likely to carry the virus unnoticed. That makes sense.” (2021-01-01,\n423 retweets)\nAn interesting distinction can be observed for the common links towards life. In the left-leaning narrative,\nthe main tweets revolve around saving lives:\n“Since 379 days!!!! we, the event industry, are in the real #harterLockdown! We also want to work\nagain. We also want to save lives! So now: #harterLockdownNow #SchulenKitasBuerosZu #LebenRetten\n#YesToNoCovid #DoItKanzlerin #AlarmstufeRot” (2021-04-05, 305 retweets)\n“So that we can get the pandemic under control quickly, protect health, lives and economies and meet and\ncelebrate again in pubs and concerts in the summer ... #harterLockdownNow” (2021-03-28, 241 retweets)\n“I’m a mother and I’m calling for a #hardLockdownNow to be put in place so that we can save lives!”\n(2021-03-28, 124 retweets)\nOn the right, we rather observe a call for going back to the pre-pandemic life without government-imposed\nrestrictions:\n“The #Corona incidence in Germany has now risen to 1500 and nobody notices anything about it. I\nremember that with an incidence of 50 we have completely turned off all public life. #ItsoverKarl” (2022-\n03-14, 568 retweets)\n“With the #Lockdown & other measures, many believe we are saving lives. Children have been forgotten.\nHow will we respond to them when they ask later, what have we done to protect them? Strengthen your\nimmune system? Strengthen your life?” (2021-10-31, 25 retweets)\nThe vaccination is criticized heavily by the right-leaning camp:\n“After 3 years of propaganda it is obvious: - Covid was just a flu - The mortality rates were fake - Masks\nwere useless - The vaccination was useless and harmful - Closing schools was useless - The high priests of\nthe Covid cult are corrupt businessmen What now?” (2023-02-11, 4048 retweets)\n“Seriously, what’s going on here? The pandemic is over. SARS-CoV-2 is endemic. Omikron usually has\nonly cold potential. Hospitals are not overloaded. Nevertheless, there is still a debate about vaccination,\nmasking, etc. irrational measures. It’s a mass psychosis!” (2022-02-22, 2841 retweets)\nIn this context, we observe a focus on side-effects, which is important in the right-leaning camp, but not\non the left:\n23\n“1. When I noticed in 2020 that the R value had fallen under one, it disappeared from the discussion. 2.\nWhen the vaccination effectiveness became negative, the RKI submitted the reports. 3. When the side\neffects rose, the PEI took the database from the network. Do you trust the government?” (2022-07-07,\n3610 retweets)\n“Many acquaintances got the vaccine only for convenience. They were allowed to go to the restaurant. I\nwasn’t. They were allowed to travel. I wasn’t. They were allowed to go to Christmas market. I wasn’t. Now\neven BMG and ÖRR are admitting side effects and they get to deal with the fear. I didn’t.” (2022-08-13,\n2369 retweets)\nConversely, the vaccination’s effectiveness is highlighted on the left:\n“A global pandemic. 4.5 million people die. There is a vaccine. But only in rich countries. Free. Voluntary.\nNevertheless, people protest against the vaccination. And against tests. And against masks. And against\nrestrictions in public spaces.” (2021-09-04, 2780 retweets)\n“(1) This graph from Israel shows what lies before us . It is quite clear that covid vaccination will significantly\nreduce both the incidence and mortality when more than 50% of the population has first vaccination. We\nwill achieve this by the end of May. So there are still 6 weeks left. What do we do?” (2021-04-18, 1618\nretweets)\nLockdowns are discussed almost equally much in both camps, but the position towards them is a different\none. While the left largely approves of them:\n“The Federal Health Minister calls for immediate lockdown. Karl Lauterbach calls for immediate lockdown.\nScientists call for immediate lockdown. Association of Intensive Medicine calls for immediate lockdown.\nWHOSE ADVICE ARE YOU WAITING FOR? BATMAN?! #COVID19 #hardLockdownNow” (2021-03-\n28, 4019 retweets)\n“(1) There must be a nationwide lockdown as soon as possible. 30,000 newly infected and 600 dead in\none day (!) without any improvement in sight. So we cannot celebrate Christmas. Nothing is Christian\nabout shopping and celebrating before we act” (2020-12-11, 1069 retweets)\n“The AfD is - against mask duty - against lockdown - against test duty - to ensure that positive tests are\nnot considered to be infected The AfD reacts to Corona exactly as it does to the climate crisis: simply\ndeny and do nothing.” (2021-04-10, 1013 retweets)\nThe right tends to condemn the lockdown measures:\n“Unvaccinated in Poland: hotel, restaurant, shopping, swimming pool. Everything possible. Unvaccinated\nin Germany: lockdown, exclusion and confinement to private. Same virus, similar incidence and only 54%\nvaccination rate in Poland. Tell me! Germany is finished. #Unvaccinated” (2021-12-04, 1205 retweets)\n“With the prospect of an end to the measures, the citizens swallowed lockdown, masking, exclusion and\nvaccination. But the politics did not keep their promises. It remains endless and unfortunately also\nevidenceless! With @Karl_Lauterbach it will start again from the front in autumn.” (2022-06-02, 1199\nretweets)\n“++EIL++ @Karl_Lauterbach has blown up the evaluation of the measures according to the WORLD.\nShould fall lockdown, 2G/3G, masking force in D therefore come again without any evidence, illegal and\ninternationally isolated?” (2022-06-02, 1181 retweets)\nConflict network\nOn the right, there are a large number of connections that do not exist on the left at all. For one, there\nis the connection between the pandemic and Bill Gates:\n“Bill Gates is already planning the next pandemic... In India the production is very cost-effective and the\nvalue creation is probably the biggest. The virus of the \"next pandemic\" is certainly already sleeping in the\nlaboratories. The vaccine as well. It is simply still grotesque what we are told!” (2021-09-15, 143 retweets)\n24\nWe find the attack on freedom as well, by politicians and other entities:\n“Some politicians want to gradually downgrade freedom and civil rights. This totalitarian-inspired #Sche-\ninfürsorge is clearly explained & is already openly debated. Only incalculable scream for a guardian, but\nnot self-thinking citizens! “ąNo vaccination obligation” (2022-02-08, 133 retweets)\n“If I read politicians talking about # vaccination obligations, \"more freedoms\" for # vaccinated people (so\nno more fundamental rights), etc. here just before the elections... ...then I don’t believe in the elections\nanymore!” (2021-07-26, 65 retweets)\nPoliticians instate fear:\n“100 hospitals were closed during the pandemic and 4,000 beds were dismantled.

Politically, the immunity obligation may\nbe desired - it is not meaningful.” (2022-03-17, 508 retweets)\nWhile on the left, there is a critique of the entanglement between science and politics:\n“The RKI has the task of making scientific recommendations for political action - also in public.

Science must be independent of politics.”\n(2021-12-21, 236 retweets)\nChristian Drosten is also antagonized on the right:\n“Drosten has already committed suicide in 2009 with his misjudgments to the population.

They feared further harm early on.” (2021-12-30, 225 retweets)\nOne central element of division is the role of masks in preventing the virus spread. The left tends to\nstrongly support the use of masks:\n25\n“Superspreading outbreaks prove: the virus can stay for hours in the #air of indoor rooms. 1.5 - 2.0\n#distance does not protect against contaminated #aerosols in toilets, restaurants or classrooms.

The right-leaning cluster tries to deligitmize the protests:\n“For 5 days we have been researching in #Luetzerath. There, the media and politics are stylizing a radical\nclimate camp for resistance.

This shows\na trend towards *less* forest fires and *less* burnt land. @GoeringEckardt Let us fight disinformation\ntogether. « GoeringEckardt: Even in Europe, more and more forest fires are raging.

On the right, we see a\nsub-narrative of “response skepticism” in which Germany should not act because it will not make a\ndifference considering the global scale of the problem:\n“In the end, a #climate strike is just big nonsense. We can make the whole of Germany climate neutral,\nbut it will not have any effect, because nobody in the world will follow our example. Therefore, go to work\nor to school.” (2021-09-24, 120 retweets)\n“Do these dreamers believe that climate change will stop at the German borders if Germany becomes\nclimate neutral, but nobody else will stick to it?

On the right, there\nare claims that the Last Generation activists are endangering democracy:\n“Don’t even understand why everyone is so surprised, because the #Last Generation seems to hate the\n#democracy - that’s what they say in talk shows, @Luisamneubauer also say.

We see that the Greens are criticized here by both camps: by the left for not doing enough:\n“I believe two sentences to be true at the same time: 1. The Greens are the only party with a realistic\noption of power that is committed to climate protection and must therefore be strengthened. 2. The\nGreens need pressure to put climate protection at the top of the agenda.” (2023-03-29, 13 retweets)\n“The Greens have simply sacrificed climate protection completely for the FDP.

This also has to do with the blockade of nuclear power. The Greens should finally\nprefer climate protection to ideology!” (2023-03-04, 59 retweets)\nTurning to the actors that are only present in one camp, we observe again that on the left, Armin Laschet\nis criticized for not taking climate protection seriously:\n“Armin Laschet demands more climate protection at noon and rejects it exactly four hours later. That\nis such an opportunistic, stupid rumour-mongering - how could the CDU come up with the idea that\nsomeone like that could be a chancellor?” (2021-07-15, 2855 retweets)\nFurthermore, the FDP is criticized for not caring about climate protection and instrumentalizing “freedom”\nwhen they see it fit:\n“Transport Minister @Wissing lies at #Maischberger and through a question by \"question the state\" it\nturns out that the @FDP minister only met with his Climate Council more than a year after taking office.\n#Climate protection is ignored by the FDP. /PM” (2023-03-24, 769 retweets)\n“At every opportunity, the FDP calls for freedom!

Unbelievable.”\n(2023-04-22, 126 retweets)\nWe also observe that the company responsible for the demolition of Lützerath, RWE, is not mentioned\non the right. The left, on the other hand, is quite vocal about the danger it poses for the climate:\n29\n“The demonstration is on!

A country that deals with gender and the rescue of the world is incapable of solving real\nproblems.” (2021-07-18, 206 retweets)\nThe authorities too are blamed for not warning about the floods early enough:\n“Authorities, politicians and public broadcasters apparently did not want to warn people of the flood.”\n(2021-07-19, 86 retweets)\nFinally, we find one central issue on the right, which is the relationship between human-induced CO2\nemissions and climate change:\n“There is no “man-made” climate change. But there is a man-made #ClimateScam that benefits its\n“inventors” alone.” (2023-03-07, 205 retweets)\n“The Earth’s climate has always changed at all times. “Climate change” is a banality.

    "content": "### Paper Interpretation and Analysis Report\n\n---\n\n## 1. **Core Content and Key Contributions**\n\nThe title of the paper is **\"Conflicting Narratives and Polarization on Social Media\"**. The author analyzes **conflicting narratives** on social media to reveal the **discursive mechanisms** behind political polarization and issue alignment. The main contributions of the paper include:\n\n### **Core Content**\n- **Narratives as Interpretive Frameworks**: Narratives serve as key tools for understanding political reality. They simplify political events into easily digestible stories, embedding causality and character roles (e.g., heroes, villains).\n- **Polarization Analysis**: Using Twitter data from Germany between 2021 and 2023, the paper illustrates political polarization, particularly around issues like the Ukraine war, the pandemic, and climate change.\n- **Identification of Conflicting Narratives**:\n  - **Differential Role Assignment** (Different Attributions of Actantial Roles): Different groups assign opposing roles to the same actor in the same event. For example, NATO is seen by the left as a protector in the Ukraine war, while the right views it as a war instigator.\n  - **Differential Actors** (Different Actants for the Same Event): Certain actors appear only in one side’s narrative. For instance, the right emphasizes Bill Gates as a conspiratorial figure in pandemic narratives, while the left omits this.\n\n### **Key Contributions**\n- **Methodological Innovation**: Introduces a narrative signal extraction method combining **Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR)** with **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, modeling conflicting narratives through **actantial networks**.\n- **Empirical Insights**: First systematic exploration of narrative mechanisms behind social media polarization, especially the phenomenon of **narrative alignment** across issues.\n- **Theoretical Expansion**: Offers a new theoretical lens for studying political polarization—understanding ideological divides through narrative analysis.\n\n---\n\n## 2. **Breakthroughs and Innovations**\n\n### **2.1 Methodological Innovation**\n- **AMR + LLM Narrative Extraction**:\n  - Uses **Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR)** to perform structured semantic parsing of tweets.\n  - Leverages the **Phi-4 model** for **context-sensitive relation classification** (support, conflict, neutral), overcoming limitations of traditional dictionary-based methods.\n- **Actantial Network Modeling**:\n  - Constructs relational networks between actors, identifying key narrative signals through edge weights and relationship types (support/conflict).\n  - Detects narrative divergences across groups via **conflicting edges**.\n\n### **2.2 Content Innovation**\n- **First Systematic Cross-Issue Analysis of Conflicting Narratives**:\n  - Goes beyond single-issue analysis (e.g., pandemic, climate) to uncover **narrative consistency and alignment mechanisms** across different issues.\n  - For example, the right consistently emphasizes **\"freedom under threat\"**, **\"media lies\"**, and **\"fear-based politics\"** across multiple issues.\n- **Revealing the Mechanism of \"Narrative Alignment\"**:\n  - Issues are linked together through shared narrative elements (e.g., “fear,” “freedom,” “media manipulation”), forming ideological coalitions.\n  - For example, the concept of “climate lockdown” draws a parallel between climate policy and pandemic restrictions, creating cross-issue opposition.\n\n### **2.3 Theoretical Contributions**\n- **Narratives as a Core Tool for Polarization Analysis**:\n  - Argues that narratives are not just expressions of positions, but **central mechanisms shaping political reality, driving polarization, and fostering issue alignment**.\n- **Introduction of the \"Metanarrative\" Perspective**:\n  - Contrasts the **left’s “solidarity and responsibility” narrative** with the **right’s “freedom and fear” narrative**, identifying these as deep structures underlying cross-issue polarization.\n\n---\n\n## 3. **Startup Project Recommendations**\n\nBased on the paper’s findings on conflicting narratives, polarization, and narrative alignment on social media, here are several promising entrepreneurial directions:\n\n---\n\n### **3.1 Social Media Narrative Monitoring and Polarization Alert Platform**\n\n#### **Project Description**\nDevelop an AI-driven social media monitoring platform that identifies **conflicting narratives** around political and social issues and predicts potential **polarization risks**.\n\n#### **Key Features**\n- **Conflict Narrative Detection**: Identifies narrative differences between groups for the same event (e.g., “NATO as peacekeeper” vs. “NATO as warmonger”).\n- **Polarization Trend Prediction**: Predicts whether an issue will trigger large-scale polarization based on narrative alignment and sentiment shifts.\n- **Visual Analytics**: Generates **actantial network diagrams** to visually represent narrative structures across different groups.\n\n#### **Target Customers**\n- Government agencies (for public opinion monitoring)\n- Media companies (for reporting strategy optimization)\n- Political consulting firms (for voter sentiment analysis)\n\n#### **Business Model**\n- SaaS subscription (charged by number of monitored topics)\n- Custom analytical reports (enterprise clients)\n\n---\n\n### **3.2 Narrative-Driven Personalized Content Recommendation Engine**\n\n#### **Project Description**\nBuild a content recommendation engine based on users' ideological narrative preferences, helping platforms (news, video, social) enhance user engagement and retention.\n\n#### **Key Features**\n- **User Narrative Profiling**: Identifies users' narrative preferences (e.g., “freedom-first,” “environment-first”) through their interactions (likes, shares, comments).\n- **Personalized Content Matching**: Recommends content that aligns with users' cognitive frameworks.\n- **Polarization Mitigation Option**: Optionally recommends **cross-narrative content** to promote understanding between groups.\n\n#### **Target Customers**\n- News platforms\n- Video platforms (e.g., YouTube, TikTok)\n- Political campaigns and voter mobilization organizations\n\n#### **Business Model**\n- B2B API services (for integration into content platforms)\n- Data insight reports (for political organizations, advertisers)\n\n---\n\n### **3.3 Narrative Education and Media Literacy Training Platform**\n\n#### **Project Description**\nCreate an online education platform aimed at the general public, helping users identify **manipulative narratives** on social media and improve **media literacy and critical thinking**.\n\n#### **Key Features**\n- **Narrative Recognition Training**: Interactive games to identify narrative structures from different ideological perspectives.\n- **Misinformation Detection**: Trains users to spot **conspiracy narratives** and **emotional manipulation** tactics.\n- **Case Library and Simulation Exercises**: Provides real-world case studies and simulated social environments for practice.\n\n#### **Target Customers**\n- Educational institutions (high schools, universities)\n- NGOs (promoting media literacy)\n- Corporate training programs (digital literacy)\n\n#### **Business Model**\n- Subscription-based online courses\n- Custom training programs for institutions (B2B)\n\n---\n\n### **3.4 Cross-Platform Narrative Consistency Detection Tool**\n\n#### **Project Description**\nDevelop a tool that detects narrative consistency across platforms (e.g., Twitter, Facebook, YouTube), identifying how narratives differ and spread across different digital spaces.\n\n#### **Key Features**\n- **Multi-Platform Data Integration**: Scrapes content from Twitter, YouTube, Reddit, etc.\n- **Narrative Path Tracking**: Tracks how a specific narrative spreads from one platform to another.\n- **Platform Bias Analysis**: Evaluates how different platforms frame the same issue narratively.\n\n#### **Target Customers**\n- Academic research institutions\n- Policy makers\n- Platform content moderation teams\n\n#### **Business Model**\n- Research collaboration projects\n- Content governance solutions for platforms (B2B)\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis paper provides a **systematic analytical framework** for understanding polarization and conflicting narratives on social media, offering fresh perspectives on political communication and societal divisions. From technical innovation to content strategy, and from theory to real-world application, it opens up numerous opportunities for entrepreneurs. Whether building a **narrative monitoring platform**, developing a **personalized recommendation engine**, or launching a **media literacy initiative**, each direction holds significant market potential and social impact.",
