While AI\nhas advanced in various creative domains, its application in\ndance has primarily focused on generating choreography from\nmusical input. We present a system that enables dancers to\ndynamically shape musical environments through their move-\nments. Our multi-modal architecture creates a coherent mu-\nsical composition by intelligently combining pre-recorded\nmusical clips in response to dance movements, establishing a\nbidirectional creative partnership where dancers function as\nboth performers and composers. Through correlation analysis\nof performance data, we demonstrate emergent communica-\ntion patterns between movement qualities and audio features.\nThis approach reconceptualizes the role of AI in performing\narts—as a responsive collaborator that expands possibilities\nfor both professional dance performance and improvisational\nartistic expression across broader populations.\nIntroduction\nDance and music traditionally exist in a hierarchical relation-\nship where movement follows sound. Typically, choreog-\nraphers design dance to existing music, or collaborate with\ncomposers to create accompanying scores. Even in improvi-\nsational dance, performers respond to pre-composed or live\nmusic, but rarely influence the musical composition itself.\nArtificial intelligence now offers an opportunity to invert\nthis relationship. While most AI systems in dance maintain\nthe traditional paradigm by generating choreography from\nmusical input, our research proposes a fundamental shift:\nenabling dancers to dynamically shape musical environments\nthrough their movements. This approach reconceptualizes\ndancers as both performers and composers, establishing a\nbidirectional creative partnership between human movement\nand AI-created sound.\nIn this paper, we present a system that enables dancers\nto dynamically influence musical composition in real-time\nthrough their movements. Our technical contribution is a\nmulti-modal architecture (Figure 1) that selects and seam-\nlessly combines pre-recorded musical clips in response to\na dancer’s movement patterns. Unlike previous approaches,\nour system creates an evolving musical environment where\nthe dancer becomes an active co-creator of the soundscape\nrather than merely responding to it. We demonstrate through\ncorrelation analysis of pilot performances that this approach\ncreates emergent communication patterns between dancer\nand system, establishing meaningful bidirectional relation-\nships between specific movement qualities and audio fea-\ntures.\nFigure 1: System diagram\nThis approach not only transforms dance performance\nbut also opens new theoretical and practical directions for\nstudying creative partnership between human performers and\nAI systems. While considerable research has examined AI’s\nrole in generating static artistic content like images or poetry,\nthe dynamic, real-time nature of dance performance presents\nunique challenges that remain largely unexplored.\nRelated Work\nExisting research in dance and AI has primarily focused on\ngenerating choreographic movements from musical input.\nTang et al. (2018) developed an LSTM-autoencoder model\nthat synthesizes dance choreography by mapping acoustic\nfeatures to motion features, addressing the challenge of select-\ning appropriate dance figures that match musical elements.\nLee et al. (2019) proposed a synthesis-by-analysis frame-\nwork that decomposes dance into basic units to generate\nstyle-consistent and beat-matching movements from music.\nWhile these approaches demonstrate technical sophistica-\ntion in movement generation, they maintain the traditional\nunidirectional relationship where dance follows music.\nSome researchers have begun exploring more interactive\napproaches to AI in dance. Kumar et al. (2020) developed\nLuminAI, an improvisational dance installation where an\nAI agent dances with users, implementing a lead-and-follow\ndynamic based on creativity metrics. The choreographic duo\nAΦE’s recent “Lilith.Aeon” performance, as reported in The\nGuardian (Winship 2024), demonstrated how an AI system\ntrained on human-generated movements could become an ac-\ntive creative partner, suggesting new movement possibilities\nwhile maintaining the distinctive style of the choreographers.\nThe Royal Ballet choreographer Wayne McGregor’s collabo-\nration with Google Arts & Culture Lab produced AISOMA, a\nsystem that suggests new movement variations by analyzing\nrehearsal videos, expanding the choreographic possibilities\navailable to dancers and choreographers (Winship 2024).\nTheoretical Foundations. This research builds on several\ntheoretical foundations that help frame our understanding of\nhuman-AI creative collaboration. Particularly relevant is the\nconcept of “mixed-initiative creative interfaces” developed\nby Deterding et al. (2017), which describes systems where\nhuman and computational agents take turns contributing to an\nevolving artistic work. In the context of dance performance,\nthis framework takes on new dimensions as the collaboration\nhappens in real-time, with the dancer’s physical movements\nand the AI’s musical responses creating a dynamic feedback\nloop.\nAdditionally, our work is informed by computational cre-\nativity concepts such as Colton and Wiggins’ (2012) ”cre-\native responsibility,” where AI systems take on creative roles\nbeyond mere tools—evaluating aesthetics and inventing pro-\ncesses. This complements Jennings’ (2010) notion of “cre-\native autonomy,” which requires systems to independently\nevaluate and evolve their standards.\nWhile the pilot study reported in our paper establishes\ntechnical foundations, these frameworks guide our vision for\nAI systems that can function as genuine creative partners in\ndance performance.\nBeyond computational creativity, performance studies lit-\nerature on improvisation and real-time creative decision-\nmaking provides another crucial theoretical perspective.\nFoundational work by Bailey (1992) and Nachmanovitch\n(1990) established key principles of improvisational practice,\nwhile recent scholarship addresses the complexities of dance\nimprovisation and human-machine interaction. De Spain’s\n(2014) topographical approach illuminates how dancers make\nmoment-to-moment decisions, and Foster (2002) examines\nhow improvisational structures emerge through real-time\nchoreographic choices. For human-AI creative collabora-\ntion specifically, Hoffman and Weinberg’s (2011) work on\ninteractive robotic improvisation offers frameworks for un-\nderstanding how performers adapt to non-human partners.\nCarter’s (2000) analysis of improvisation as breaking estab-\nlished conventions to discover new artistic expressions that\n”could not be found in a systematic preconceived process”\nis particularly relevant. Following Carter, our system aims\nto create new paradigms that enable real-time invention and\ndiscovery through the act of creation itself.\nSystem Architecture\nOur system enables real-time generation of responsive mu-\nsical accompaniment to dance movements through a multi-\nstage machine learning pipeline. The architecture comprises\nthree primary components: (1) an audio encoding/decoding\nsystem, (2) a movement encoding system, and (3) a cross-\nmodal generation network that predicts appropriate musical\nresponses to movement. These components work in concert\nto create a cohesive interactive performance environment.\nAudio Representation Learning. To learn audio represen-\ntations, we trained a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) (Kingma\nand Welling 2014) on spectrograms of 3.5-second audio clips.\nThe audio VAE consists of convolutional layers for both en-\ncoding and decoding, with a 128-dimensional latent space\nrepresentation. This architecture effectively compresses spec-\ntrograms into a compact latent code that preserves meaningful\nacoustic properties while discarding noise. The encoder uses\nfive convolutional layers with ReLU activations to transform\ninput spectrograms (224×224×1) into a latent distribution,\nwhile the decoder reverses this process through transposed\nconvolutions.\nMovement Representation Learning. To encode dance\nmovements, we developed a parallel VAE architecture\nthat processes visual representations of movement trajec-\ntories. The movement data is collected by using Tensor-\nFlow MoveNet Thunder pipeline, which analyzes either pre-\nrecorded videos during training or webcam video stream\nduring inference. Rather than working with raw skeletal\njoint data, we first transform movement sequences into color-\ncoded trajectory images (Figure 2b). Each 3.5-second move-\nment sequence is represented as an RGB image (256×256×3)\nwhere five key landmarks (head, left wrist, right wrist, left\nankle, right ankle) are visualized as coloured curves showing\ntheir trajectories over time.\n(a) Dance timelapse photo\n(b) Movement trajectories\nFigure 2: (a) Timelapse photo of dancer’s movements. (b)\nTrajectories of dancer’s movements captured by our system.\nThe landmarks are colour-coded as follows: red - head, green\n- left wrist, blue - right wrist, orange - left ankle, magenta -\nright ankle.\nThis image-based approach allows us to leverage convo-\nlutional architectures commonly used in computer vision\nwhile capturing the temporal dynamics of movement. The\nmovement VAE employs a structure parallel to the audio\nVAE, with the encoder producing a 128-dimensional latent\nvector that encapsulates the essential spatial and temporal\ncharacteristics of the dance movement.\nCross-Modal Generation The Generative Adversarial\nNetwork (GAN) (Goodfellow et al. 2014) bridges the move-\nment and audio domains. The GAN’s generator takes two\ninputs: (1) the latent representation of the current movement\nand (2) the latent representation of the previous audio clip.\nIt then predicts the latent vector for the next audio clip that\nwould best complement the current movement.\nThe generator employs a latent combiner module that in-\ntegrates movement and audio latent vectors. While we ex-\nperimented with several combination methods (concatena-\ntion, multiplication, and various learned approaches includ-\ning gated, FiLM, and cross-attention mechanisms), we found\nthat pointwise addition produces the most effective results.\nThis addition operation is followed by a multi-layer network\nwith hidden dimensions of 256 units, LayerNorm for stabi-\nlization, and LeakyReLU activations.\nRetrieval Module Rather than directly decoding the pre-\ndicted latent vector, which could result in lower audio quality,\nwe employ a retrieval-based approach. We calculate the co-\nsine similarity between the predicted latent vector and the\nlatent representations of clips in our reference database. The\naudio clip with the highest similarity is selected, ensuring\nhigh-quality output while maintaining contextual relevance.\nFigure 3 shows how both previous audio and movement\ninfluence the system’s predictions. With identical previous\naudio but different movements, the system selects dramati-\ncally different clips: ambient music for minimal movement\n(3a) versus rhythmic clips for energetic break-dancing (3c).\nSimilarly, when movement remains constant but previous\naudio changes (3a vs. 3b), the predicted clips also differ.\nReal-time Inference We developed a React/NodeJS appli-\ncation, which operates as follows during live performance:\nMovement Capture: A webcam captures the dancer’s\nmovements, which are processed by a pose estimation model\n(TensorFlow MoveNet Thunder) to extract the five key land-\nmarks.\nMovement Encoding: The landmarks’ trajectories are ren-\ndered as a color-coded image and encoded by the movement\nVAE into a latent vector.\nAudio Prediction: The movement latent vector and the\nprevious audio clip’s latent vector are fed into the GAN,\nwhich predicts the next audio clip’s latent representation.\nClip Selection: The system retrieves the audio clip whose\nlatent representation has the highest cosine similarity to the\npredicted vector.\nAudio Playback: The selected clip is cross-faded with the\ncurrently playing audio to create seamless transitions.\nThe dancer can also curate the source audio library from\nwhich the system selects clips, allowing performers to in-\nfluence the overall sonic palette and musical style of their\nmovement-conditioned compositions.\nDataset. The aligned video-audio dataset used to train the\nmovement VAE and GAN consists of 18K 3.5-second record-\nings, 17K of which were sourced from the AIST dance dataset\n(Tsuchida et al. 2019) and 1K from our own dataset contain-\ning video material recorded specifically for this project or\nprovided to us by professional dance collaborators. The au-\ndio VAE was trained on a larger set of 50K audio clips from\nthe authors’ studio recordings, spanning multiple genres of\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\n(d)\nFigure 3: System response examples showing the influence\nof both inputs on prediction.\nelectro-acoustic music with varying tempos and instrumenta-\ntion.\nPilot study\nWe conducted a pilot study with three participants of vary-\ning dance experience: P1 (10+ years ballet), P2 (2-3 years\nballet/jazz), and P3 (no formal training). Each dancer per-\nformed improvisational movement with the system for up to\n30 minutes. We recorded both video and system-generated\naudio, collecting over 70 minutes of data. Our analysis aimed\nto identify relationships between dance movements and gen-\nerated audio, particularly examining which audio features\ncorrelate most strongly with movement intensity.\nVideo and Audio Features. We segmented performances\ninto 10-second clips and extracted movement data using\nMoveNet Thunder to track key body points (head, wrists,\nankles) normalized to [-1, 1]. Movement energy was mea-\nsured as the Euclidean distance between corresponding points\nin consecutive frames, with statistical measures (mean, min,\nmax, standard deviation) computed for each clip. For au-\ndio, we extracted 47 features using Librosa and Essentia,\nincluding spectral features (MFCCs, contrast, flux), chroma\nfeatures, and psychoacoustic measures. Key audio features\nin our analysis include MFCCs (representing timbre, with\nmfcc 1 capturing overall spectral shape), spectral contrast\n(peak-valley differences across frequency bands), chroma\n(pitch class distribution), and spectral flux (frame-to-frame\nspectral changes).\nStatistical Analysis1 To explore the relationship between\ndance movement and system-generated audio, we applied\nseveral statistical methods. Pearson correlation analysis was\nperformed to assess the linear relationships between individ-\nual movement energy measures (average, maximum, mini-\nmum, and standard deviation) and audio features. Principal\nComponent Analysis (PCA) was conducted separately on\nvideo and audio features to identify patterns of variance and\nreduce dimensionality, while Canonical Correlation Analysis\n(CCA) was used to examine the multivariate relationships\nbetween movement and audio feature spaces.\nAdditionally, we used Partial Least Squares (PLS) regres-\nsion to model predictive relationships between the two modal-\nities, evaluating how well sets of audio features could predict\nmovement energy metrics, and vice versa. To identify the\nmost influential audio features, we employed Random For-\nest regression models, computing feature importance scores\nbased on their contribution to predicting each movement en-\nergy statistic. The quality of these predictive models was\nevaluated using the coefficient of determination (R²).\nTogether, these analyses allowed us to identify which audio\nfeatures were most strongly associated with variations in\ndancers’ movement intensity and to assess the strength of the\ncoupling between movement and audio dynamics produced\nby the system.\nResults. Our analysis revealed several key relationships\nbetween movement energy and audio features generated by\nthe system.\nCorrelation Analysis. Pearson correlation analysis showed\nthat the minimum movement energy (min energy) had the\nstrongest and most consistent relationships with audio fea-\ntures. In particular, mfcc 1 (first Mel-frequency cepstral co-\nefficient) exhibited a significant negative correlation with\nmin energy (r = -0.45, p <0.001), suggesting that clips\nwith lower minimum movement energy were associated\nwith audio segments characterized by smoother spectral\nshapes.\nSpectral contrast in the sixth frequency band\n(spec contrast 6) and mfcc 7 also showed significant pos-\nitive correlations with min energy.\nPrincipal Component Analysis (PCA). PCA indicated that\na small number of components captured substantial variance\nin both movement and audio features. In particular, variations\nin energy-based movement measures (average, minimum,\nmaximum, and standard deviation) loaded heavily onto the\nfirst few principal components, while audio variance was\ndominated by MFCCs and spectral features.\nCanonical Correlation Analysis (CCA). CCA revealed\nmoderate canonical correlations between the combined move-\nment energy statistics and audio feature sets. The first canon-\nical component pair linked high standard deviation of move-\nment energy with variations in spectral complexity and disso-\nnance in the audio, indicating multivariate coupling between\nmovement expressivity and audio texture.\nPartial Least Squares (PLS) Regression. PLS regression\n1Detailed\nstatistical\nanalysis\nresults\nare\npro-\nvided\non\nthe\nsupplementary-material\nwebsite:\nhttps://sites.google.com/view/reimagining-dance\nmodels found that audio features could modestly predict\nmovement energy, with the highest R² value (0.103) for pre-\ndicting min energy. Conversely, movement features showed\nstronger predictive power for certain audio characteristics:\nmovement energy metrics could predict mfcc 1 with an R²\nof 0.202 and mfcc 7 with an R² of 0.162, suggesting that\ndancers’ movement dynamics influenced the timbral qualities\nof the generated soundtrack.\nRandom Forest Feature Importance. Random forest re-\ngressions further confirmed the importance of specific audio\nfeatures. mfcc 1, mfcc 7, spec contrast 6, and spectral flux\nconsistently emerged as the most important predictors of\nmovement energy statistics across models, aligning with the\nfindings of the linear analyses.\nOverall, the results suggest that the soundscape created\nby our system responded most consistently to variations in\ndancers’ minimum movement energy, with audio features\nrelated to timbre and spectral dynamics (MFCCs and spectral\ncontrast) showing the strongest associations with movement\nintensity.\nQualitative results Dancers reported a fluid exchange\nof initiative with the system throughout their performances.\nThe system often influenced their movement choices at both\nmacro and micro levels, inspiring exploration of new dance\nexpressions to discover corresponding musical responses.\nConversely, dancers sometimes deliberately attempted to redi-\nrect the musical atmosphere, such as introducing energetic\nmovement during ambient passages. While the system typi-\ncally required 5-10 seconds to adapt to significant changes\nin dance energy, this delay was intentionally designed to\nmaintain musical coherence. This adaptation period could\npotentially be customized based on dance genre preferences,\nbalancing responsiveness against musical continuity.\nConclusion\nThis research presents a novel approach to dance through\nAI-mediated co-creation, fundamentally reimagining the tra-\nditional relationship between movement and music. Our\nsystem enables dancers to dynamically shape musical envi-\nronments while simultaneously responding to them, creating\na bidirectional creative partnership where initiative flows\nfluidly between human and machine. Statistical analysis con-\nfirms meaningful correlations between specific movement\nqualities and audio features.\nThis work explores a multi-layered creative relationship.\nThe original composer’s musical intent—which may itself be\nimprovisational—becomes raw material for a new emergent\ncomposition, dynamically rearranged and remixed through\nthe dancer’s movements. The resulting sonic experience\nis a form of real-time collage where three creative forces\nconverge: the original compositional elements, the system’s\nalgorithmic decision-making, and the dancer’s embodied ex-\npression. Each performance thus represents a unique re-\nlationship between these creative entities, with the dancer\nphysically sculpting a new musical composition from frag-\nments of the composer’s work, creating something neither\ncould have produced independently.\nBy inverting the traditional paradigm where movement\nfollows sound, we position dancers as active co-creators of\nthe musical arrangements. The dance movements can serve\nas a novel compositional tool for creating musical content\nthat has artistic value beyond the performance context. This\napproach offers new creative possibilities not only to dance\nperformance, but also as a form of musical composition.\nWhile the system was primarily envisioned as a co-creative\nartistic framework for dance performance, another promising\napplication emerged during our pilot study. We observed that\nwhen participant dancers experienced fatigue and naturally\nreduced their movement intensity, the system organically\ntransitioned from dynamic rhythmic music to more ambient\nsoundscapes. This adaptive quality could be valuable not\nonly in dance performance, but also in exercise and training\nsettings.\nWe are currently planning a large-scale study with a pro-\nfessional dance company to evaluate the system’s impact on\nchoreographic process and audience reception. Through this\nongoing research, we aim to develop a deeper understand-\ning of the emergent creative language that evolves between\nhuman dancers and AI musical collaborators.\nReferences\nBailey, D. 1992.

    "content": "# Paper Analysis and Interpretation\n\n## 1. Core Content and Major Contributions\nThe core content of this paper introduces a system based on a multi-modal architecture that can generate and adjust musical environments in real-time through the movements of dancers. Specifically, the system integrates audio encoding/decoding, motion encoding, and cross-modal generative networks, enabling dancers to dynamically shape their musical environment through their movements, thereby establishing a two-way creative partnership.\n\nThe main contributions include:\n- **Redefining the relationship between dance and music**: In traditional dance performances, movements are usually a response to music. However, the system proposed in this paper makes dancers part of the music creation process, achieving a two-way interaction between movement and music.\n- **Multi-modal architecture**: A multi-modal architecture has been developed that can intelligently combine pre-recorded music segments in response to the dancer's movement patterns, creating coherent musical pieces.\n- **Empirical research**: Through correlation analysis, it was shown that this system can produce emerging communication patterns between movement characteristics and audio features, establishing a meaningful two-way relationship.\n\n## 2. Breakthroughs or Innovations\n- **Two-way creative collaboration**: Unlike previous applications of AI in dance (such as generating choreography based on music), this study proposes a new paradigm where dancers not only act as performers but also participate as composers in the music creation process.\n- **Real-time interaction**: The system operates in real-time, instantly responding to changes in the dancer’s movements to create a dynamic musical environment.\n- **Theoretical foundation expansion**: Combining theoretical frameworks such as computational creativity and hybrid active creative interfaces, it provides new perspectives for understanding and designing human-machine creative collaborations.\n- **Data-driven feedback mechanism**: Statistical analyses (such as Pearson correlation analysis, principal component analysis, etc.) were used to validate the connection between movements and generated music, proving the system's effectiveness.\n\n## 3. Good Ideas for Entrepreneurial Projects\nBased on the content of this paper, here are some suitable directions for entrepreneurial projects:\n\n### (1) **Personalized Music Creation Platform**\nDevelop a personalized music creation platform for general users who can generate background music in real-time through simple body movements (e.g., gestures, head movements). This platform can be used for home entertainment, education, or social activities, allowing users without musical knowledge to participate in music creation.\n\n- **Application scenarios**: Family gatherings, school art classes, rehabilitation training, etc.\n- **Technical implementation**: Utilize the motion recognition and music generation technologies from the paper, simplify the user interface, and lower the usage threshold.\n\n### (2) **Immersive Experience in Virtual Reality (VR)**\nApply this system to VR environments to create an immersive virtual space for dance and music creation. Users can influence the musical environment in real-time through their own movements in the virtual world, providing a completely new interactive entertainment experience.\n\n- **Application scenarios**: Online games, virtual concerts, remote teaching, etc.\n- **Technical implementation**: Combine VR motion capture technology with the multi-modal generative model described in the paper to enhance user experience.\n\n### (3) **Fitness and Rehabilitation Assistance Tool**\nLeverage the system's sensitivity to movement intensity and develop a tool aimed at fitness and rehabilitation. When users exercise, the system can automatically adjust the music rhythm based on the user's movement intensity, helping them maintain motivation and optimize their workout results.\n\n- **Application scenarios**: Gyms, home workouts, rehabilitation centers, etc.\n- **Technical implementation**: Integrate motion capture sensors and the music generation algorithms from the paper, designing music adjustment strategies tailored to different scenarios.\n\n### (4) **Professional Dance Choreography Assistant**\nProvide professional dance teams with an advanced choreography assistant that allows choreographers and dancers to explore new possibilities in dance and music combinations through real-time interaction. This can not only improve creation efficiency but also inspire more creativity.\n\n- **Application scenarios**: Professional dance troupes, art colleges, performance production companies, etc.\n- **Technical implementation**: Further optimize the system's precision and response speed, supporting complex dance movements and music styles.\n\n### (5) **Educational Tool: Nurturing Children's Creativity**\nDesign an educational tool specifically for children that guides them to explore music creation through simple and fun game formats using movements, cultivating their creativity and artistic perception.\n\n- **Application scenarios**: Kindergartens, elementary school art courses, family parent-child activities, etc.\n- **Technical implementation**: Simplify the interface design, add fun elements, ensure usability and appeal.\n\nAll of these projects fully utilize the technologies and concepts mentioned in the paper, being both innovative and having broad market potential.",
