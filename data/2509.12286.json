INTRODUCTION\nAccurate price prediction can aid in determining risk expo-\nsure, setting margin limits, and issuing margin calls, among\nother things. Nevertheless, the volatile nature of markets and\nthe influence of multiple factors, such as policy changes,\ninterest rate shifts, and currency fluctuations, make this process\ncomplex. Stock price prediction is essential for investors,\nfinancial analysts, and traders as it provides insights into\nfuture market trends. Accurate predictions enable investors\nto make informed decisions regarding buying, holding, or\nselling stocks, which can significantly affect their financial\nreturns. Given the inherent volatility and complexity of finan-\ncial markets, effective prediction models are crucial for risk\nmanagement, portfolio optimization, and strategic planning.\nReliable stock price forecasts help in minimizing losses and\nmaximizing profits by identifying potential opportunities and\nthreats in the market. For individual investors, it means better\ninvestment strategies and higher returns. For financial insti-\ntutions, it enables the development of sophisticated trading\nalgorithms, enhancing the efficiency and profitability of their\ntrading operations. Companies can use these predictions to\nmake strategic business decisions, such as timing for issuing\nnew shares or buybacks. Additionally, accurate forecasts con-\ntribute to market stability by reducing the likelihood of large,\nunexpected price swings. This predictability can also foster\ninvestor confidence, attracting more capital into the markets\nand supporting overall economic growth. [1]\nFully Quantum Generative Adversarial Networks (QGANs)\nare advanced machine learning models that leverage the prin-\nciples of quantum computing to enhance generative modeling\ncapabilities. Traditional GANs consist of a generator and a\ndiscriminator, where the generator creates synthetic data, and\nthe discriminator evaluates its authenticity. [2] QGANs incor-\nporate quantum algorithms into this framework, potentially\nproviding exponential speed-ups and improved accuracy due to\nquantum parallelism and entanglement. In stock price predic-\ntion, QGANs can process complex patterns and correlations in\nhistorical market data more efficiently than classical models,\ngenerating realistic synthetic data that closely mirrors actual\nmarket behaviors. This capability allows QGANs to produce\nmore accurate and reliable stock price forecasts, aiding in\nbetter decision-making for investors and financial analysts.\n[28]\nClassical Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in fi-\nnance are primarily used for generating synthetic financial\ntime-series data, which is valuable for backtesting trading\nstrategies, risk assessment, and stress testing financial models.\nThey can capture complex patterns in financial data, such\nas volatility and correlations. Additionally, GANs are used\nfor anomaly detection in financial data, identifying poten-\ntial fraud, market manipulation, or sudden price changes.\nBy learning normal patterns, they can pinpoint suspicious\ndeviations. Classical GANs are also employed to enhance\nfinancial forecasting by creating more realistic data for training\npredictive models, thereby improving the accuracy of stock\nprice forecasts. They aid in risk management by generating\nvarious market scenarios, helping financial institutions better\nunderstand their risk exposure.\narXiv:2509.12286v1  [cs.LG]  14 Sep 2025\nFig. 1. GAN Architecture from paper [27]\nFig. 2. QGAN Architecture from paper [26]\nII. PROBLEM FORMULATION: GANS TO QGANS\nWe propose a generalized Quantum Generative Adversarial\nNetwork that takes advantage of the classical GAN architec-\nture integrated with quantum-enhanced prediction power. [24]\nGANs are a popular artificial intelligence model that consists\nof two neural networks, as shown in Figure 1:\n• Generator: Replicates a real-world dataset by producing\nsynthetic data samples (e.g., text, audio, and/or photos).\n• Discriminator: Assists in differentiating between authen-\ntic data and the generator’s synthetic examples.\nTo “fake“ realistic historical and future stock price data,\nmimicking real market dynamics and capturing complex rela-\ntionships, the two competing entities, Generator and Discrimi-\nnator, collaborate when using GANs for stock price prediction.\nThe other part of the system acts as a critic, attempting to\ndiscern fake data from the real historical price data. As a\nresult of their ongoing competition, the discriminator improves\nat spotting departures from actual market trends, while the\ngenerator gradually grows more skilled at producing realistic\nand representative data. The idea behind this is that after\ngoing through this training process, the generator could be able\nto provide “future” market data that almost exactly matches\ncurrent prices, which could aid in prediction.\nTraining Loop and Feedback\n• The generator is trained based on input from the discrim-\ninator, which pushes it to produce more realistic data\nthat can trick the discriminator. The generator and dis-\ncriminator are simultaneously improved by this iterative\nadversarial process. [4]\n• The model’s performance is determined by calculating\nthe difference between the discriminator’s predicted prob-\nability and the true label (real or created) using the loss\nfunction.\n• The discriminator’s weights and biases are updated using\nthe loss using backpropagation, a method of modifying\nmodel parameters in response to prediction mistakes. The\ngoal of this procedure is to increase the discriminator’s\ncapacity to differentiate between produced and actual data\nin later rounds.\nThe iterative adversarial process improves both the gener-\nator and discriminator simultaneously. Using a loss function,\nmodel performance is determined by evaluating the difference\nbetween predicted probabilities and true labels. Backpropaga-\ntion updates the discriminator’s weights and biases, enhancing\nits ability to differentiate between produced and actual data in\nsubsequent rounds.\nIn the realm of QGANs, the discriminator employs a\nsupervised learning technique, often a Quantum Deep Neural\nNetwork (DNN). [18] Maintaining a delicate balance between\nthe discriminator’s ability to identify fakes and the generator’s\ncapacity to produce realistic data ensures continuous improve-\nment throughout training.\nLike in classical techniques, to categorise data as genuine\nor produced, the discriminator in QGAN usually uses a\nsupervised learning technique, most often a quantum deep\nneural network (DNN). Unstable QGAN training and less-\nthan-ideal outcomes might arise from a discriminator with\ninadequate training. The discriminator’s capacity to identify\nfakes and the generator’s capacity to generate realistic data\nmust be balanced. This equilibrium makes sure that throughout\ntraining, both components become better repeatedly.\nIII. DATA PREPARATION\nData preparation is an essential initial phase in any predic-\ntive modeling endeavor, including those employing Quantum\nGenerative Adversarial Networks (QGANs) for stock price\nprediction. This process encompasses several critical steps,\nbeginning with the acquisition of pertinent historical financial\ndata, stock prices, trading volumes, and economic indica-\ntors, sourced from reputable databases or market exchanges.\nSubsequent preprocessing involves cleaning and transforming\nraw data, handling missing values, outliers, and normalizing\nor scaling to ensure consistency and comparability. Feature\nengineering follows, creating new variables or features to\ncapture relevant patterns within the data, such as technical\nindicators or additional market-related factors.\nWe have used a real-market dataset for our analysis, specif-\nically focusing on the FTSE stock price index. The dataset\nspans 10 years. [6]\nAnother vital aspect is data encoding, converting processed\ndata into a format compatible with the QGAN architecture,\ntypically involving numerical vectorization or tensor conver-\nsion. Finally, data partitioning divides the dataset into training,\ntesting sets to facilitate model training, evaluation, and vali-\ndation. This partitioning ensures that the model’s performance\nis assessed on unseen data, guarding against overfitting and\nenhancing generalization to new market conditions. In sum-\nmary, meticulous data preparation establishes the groundwork\nfor developing robust predictive models, enabling the effective\nutilization of QGANs for stock price prediction.\nIV. QGANS\nQuantum Generative Adversarial Networks (QGANs) rep-\nresent a novel approach within the realm of quantum com-\nputing, mirroring their classical counterparts but operating\nwithin the quantum framework. As described in textbooks,\nQGANs consist of two main components: the qGenerator and\nthe qDiscriminator. The qGenerator is tasked with producing\nsynthetic data samples, while the qDiscriminator distinguishes\nbetween real and generated data.\nTraining a QGAN involves an iterative process where both\ncomponents are trained concurrently, fostering a competitive\ndynamic. This adversarial training encourages the qGenerator\nto produce increasingly realistic data, while the qDiscriminator\nimproves its ability to discern between real and synthetic\nsamples. [5], [21], [22]\nReal-world market data may closely resemble synthetic\nfinancial data produced by QGANs, despite the inherent\nidiosyncrasies and complexity. This makes it feasible to get\nbeyond limitations on real data availability and variety, which\nenhances training datasets for prediction models. By gen-\nerating a range of scenarios and market swings, QGANs\nmay help assess how robust prediction models are in several\ncontexts, leading to more adaptable and durable forecasts. By\nidentifying hidden patterns, QGANs may be able to identify\ncomponents that conventional models would miss by using\nthe entanglement characteristics of qubits [26]. Breakdown of\nQGAN’s operational parts:\n• qGenerator:\n– Data Encoding: Historical prices, volume, and eco-\nnomic indicators of real-world stocks are pre-\nprocessed and encoded into vectors that are com-\npatible with the GAN architecture.\n– Noise Injection: Adding random noise to the en-\ncoded data is known as “noise injection”. In addition\nto adding variation, this keeps the generator from just\nmemorising past data.\n– Quantum Operations: Quantum circuits and opera-\ntions may be employed in more sophisticated meth-\nods to represent intricate non-linear correlations seen\nin the financial data, possibly producing more real-\nistic simulations.\n– Deep Learning Network: After being processed by\nseveral deep learning layers (such as convolutional or\nrecurrent neural networks), the noisy encoded data is\nrefined to produce the “fake” pricing data sequence.\n• qDiscriminator:\n– Feature Extraction: Similar to the generator, the dis-\ncriminator uses deep learning layers to extract fea-\ntures from both data sets.\n– Data Comparison: The discriminator receives both\nthe real historical price data and the generated data\nfrom the generator.\n– Real/Fake Classification: Based on the extracted fea-\ntures, the discriminator outputs a probability score\nindicating its confidence in whether the data is real\nor generated.\nFig. 3. Proposed QGAN Model for Stock Price Prediction\nOne of the notable advantages of QGANs lies in their\ncapacity to capture intricate patterns and relationships within\ndatasets, including those with quantum characteristics. This\nfeature is particularly advantageous in domains such as stock\nprice prediction, where conventional models may struggle to\ncapture the complexities of financial markets.\nIn essence, QGANs offer a promising avenue for data\ngeneration and manipulation within the quantum computing\ndomain, with potential applications spanning various fields,\nincluding finance, healthcare, and materials science.\nA. Hybrid Quantum GAN\nIn the hybrid quantum GAN, we replace the classical\ngenerator with the quantum circuit as shown in Fig. 4. The\ndiscriminator remains classical. The data is encoded as angles\nof rotation gates. The number of qubits grows with the size\nof the past window.\nFig. 4. Quantum circuit as a generator for Hybrid QGAN for a past window\nof 3 days and future of 1 day. Pauli-Z observable on the first qubit.\nB. Fully Quantum GAN\nWe have managed to implement a fully Quantum GAN\nduring our phase 2 testing. This was done by removing the\nconventional classical discriminator and replacing it with a\nswap test. At its core, our QGAN architecture comprises three\nkey components:\n• Data Encoder: This component plays a pivotal role in the\ntransformation of classical input data into quantum states.\nBy embedding real-world financial data into quantum\nstates, the Data Encoder initiates the quantum computing\nprocess and facilitates subsequent quantum operations.\n• Variational Quantum Circuit (VQC) based Generator:\nThe VQC-based Generator constitutes the heart of the\nQGAN architecture, responsible for generating synthetic\ndata that closely mimics real-world market dynamics.\nLeveraging the principles of variational quantum circuits,\nthis component employs quantum operations to generate\nsynthetic data sequences with high fidelity and realism.\n• SWAP Test-Based Discriminator: In a departure from tra-\nditional discriminator architectures, the SWAP Test-based\nDiscriminator represents a fully quantum approach to\ndiscerning between real and synthetic data. By employing\nSWAP tests, which measure the fidelity between quantum\nstates, this discriminator evaluates the similarity between\nthe real and fake data generated by the VQC-based\nGenerator. Also, there are no parameters that need to be\ntrained here.\n• Window Size and Prediction Horizon: The QGAN archi-\ntecture adopts a specific window size and prediction\nhorizon, with a 3-day window utilized for predicting 1-\nday stock price movements. To encode relevant features\nof the financial data, angle encoding is employed, chosen\nfor its noise immunity and simplicity of implementation\nwithin the quantum framework.\n1) Architecture for larger future window: To incorporate a\nlarger future window in the FQGAN(Fully Quantum GAN),\nwe used Amplitude Embedding to encode data in the quantum\ncircuit. We provide an overview of the pipeline used:\n1) The adjusted closing price data is used. We eliminate\nthe noise in the data by applying a Hodrick-Prescott [?]\nsmoothing, which extracts the data, followed by splitting\nthe data into training (80%) and testing (20%) datasets.\n2) We perform min-max scaling to scale the prices between\n0 and 1, followed by normalizing the datasets, i.e l2\nnorm should be 1. The normalization is essential for\namplitude embedding.\n3) Train the FQGAN. Used the trained weights to obtain\npredictions.\n4) Inverse the normalization and min-max scaling to obtain\nthe predicted future prices. Reapply the Hodrick-Prescott\nto eliminate the noise in predictions.\nThe number of qubits scales based on the following relation\n⌈log2 b⌉+ ⌈log2 f⌉+ 1\n(1)\nWhere b (backward) is the size of the past window and\nf (forward/future) is the size of the future window. One\nadditional qubit is required for the SWAP test measurement.\n2) Limitation: One limitation of this architecture is that\nwe need to store the normalization factors on the train and\ntest datasets to perform the inverse transform. In reality, this\nis not available for the test dataset (as we are predicting\nthe unknown). With the Quantum Generator, we can only\nobtain the normalized prices for the future window. This is\na limitation of the proposed FQGAN methodology.\n3) Overcoming the Limitation: To overcome the limitation\nof the normalization factor, we use a simple strategy with\nwhich we can obtain the normalization factor for the pre-\ndictions from the training dataset. We refer to the FQGAN,\nwhich uses this strategy as Invertible FQGAN. We explain the\nstrategy with the help of an example.\nConsider a past window of size 16 and a future window\nof size 8, which means that we need to predict 8 values.\nInstead of predicting 8 values, we try to predict 16 values\nin the future, i.e. we predict the 8 unknowns as well as the 8\nknowns that are in the past window of size 16. Once trained\non this type of data, given a past window of size 16 as input\nto the Quantum Generator, we can generate 16 values in the\nfuture out of which the first 8 overlap with the input data\n(Fig 5). Using classical optimization, we try to minimize the\nfollowing objective function to find the normalization factor.\n8\nX\ni=1\n(ai −f ˆyi)2\n(2)\nWhere ai is the min-max scaled price of the overlapping\ninput data, ˆyi is the normalized predicted price of the over-\nlapping part, and f is the normalization factor.\nOnce f is found, we can multiply it with the ˆyi and then\nperform the inverse min-max transform to obtain the prediction\nprices.\nFig. 5. Data preparation for Invertible FQGAN. We use overlapped train and\ntest data to train the model(left). Once trained, the Quantum Generator can\ngenerate 16 values in the future, which have an overlap with the input data\nand therefore the normalization factor can be obtained (right).\nV. RESULTS\nThe results presented in this section encompass the out-\ncomes of our experiments, offering a comprehensive analysis\nof the performance of each model—Classical GAN, Hybrid\nQuantum-Classical GAN, and Fully Quantum GAN—based\non key evaluation metrics: Root Mean Square Error (RMSE),\nMean Absolute Error (MAE), and the coefficient of determina-\ntion (R² score). This comparative analysis not only highlights\nthe advantages and limitations of quantum computing in\nfinancial forecasting but also provides a foundation for future\nresearch avenues in this emerging field. By contributing to\nthe ongoing discourse on the feasibility of quantum-enhanced\npredictive models, this study paves the way for significant\nadvancements in stock market prediction.\nA. One Step Forecast Results\nWe present results from experiments conducted with clas-\nsical, hybrid, and fully quantum Generative Adversarial Net-\nworks (GANs), using a past window size of 3 days to predict\nthe stock index for the next day. This window size strikes\na balance between capturing short-term market trends and\nlimiting computational complexity.\n1) Results with Classical GAN: We calculated the most\npopular technical indicators for classical GAN, including 7-\nday and 21-day moving averages, exponential moving average,\nand momentum. Along with this, we created Fourier trans-\nforms to extract long-term and short-term trends in the stock\nprices.\nFig. 6. Various technical indicators: Mean average, Momentum, etc.\nFig. 7. Fourier transforms\nThe Classical GAN model was used as a baseline for\ncomparing the performance of quantum-enhanced models. The\nstudy involved two variants: one that incorporated technical\nindicators (referred to as Classical GAN with TI), and another\nthat used only adjusted closing prices (referred to as Simple\nGAN).\nPerformance Metrics: The Classical GAN with TI model\nunderwent training for 150 epochs with a learning rate of\n0.00016 and a batch size of 128, utilizing the Adam opti-\nmizer. The performance was primarily evaluated using RMSE,\nproviding a quantitative measure of the deviation between pre-\ndicted and actual stock prices. Training and test performance\nresults are presented in Fig. 8.\nIt should be noted that these classical results are taken\nas standards, and we compare our other method results with\nthese.\n2) Results\nwith\nHybrid\nQuantum\nGAN:\nThe\nHybrid\nQuantum-Classical GAN marks an important step in inte-\ngrating quantum computation with classical models. In this\napproach, the generator employs a quantum circuit while the\ndiscriminator is based on classical architecture. Despite similar\nhyperparameters to the classical model, the Hybrid Quantum\nGAN demonstrated distinct performance characteristics.\nPerformance Metrics: Trained over 150 epochs with the\nsame learning rate and batch size as the Classical GAN,\nthe Hybrid Quantum GAN achieved a training RMSE of\n49.88 and a higher test RMSE of 84.27, indicating that the\nquantum component introduced significant variability in model\nperformance. These results highlight the challenges associated\nFig. 8. Classical GAN with Technical Indicators. Train (Up) and test (down).\nwith combining quantum and classical systems in stock price\nprediction. Fig. 9\n3) Results with Full Quantum GAN: The Fully Quantum\nGAN (FQGAN) leverages both the generator and discriminator\nas quantum circuits. This model seeks to fully exploit quantum\ncomputing’s advantages, such as parallelism and entanglement,\nto capture complex stock price patterns.\nPerformance Metrics: Trained for just 5 epochs on the\nAWS SV1 quantum simulator with a learning rate of 0.016,\nthe FQGAN model showed considerable promise despite its\nshort training duration. The model achieved a training RMSE\nof 571.36 and a test RMSE of 251.89, suggesting a compet-\nitive performance, particularly when considering the limited\nquantum resources and training epochs. Fig. 10.\n4) Results across Varying Window Sizes: We also explored\nthe effect of varying past window sizes on the performance of\nthe four models. The results indicate that the Hybrid Quantum\nGAN exhibits a decline in performance as the window size\nincreases, while the FQGAN’s RMSE improves up to a\nwindow size of 5, before deteriorating at a window size of\n10. Fig. 11\nFig. 9. Hybrid Quantum GAN. Train (Up) and test (Down).\n5) Results on AWS using SV1 Simulator: While running\nthe experiments on the SV1 quantum simulator, we faced\nchallenges due to the unavailability of real hardware devices\nand extended queue times. Each epoch took two hours, and\nwith a minimum of 5 epochs required to obtain significant\nresults, the total simulation time for each model stretched\nbeyond 10 hours. Due to these limitations, we were unable\nto perform tests on real hardware.\nThe Classical GAN achieved a testing RMSE of 91.71,\nwhich serves as the standard for comparing the hybrid and\nfully quantum models. Notably, the Fully Quantum GAN\nperformed poorly in comparison, which was expected due\nto its nascent stage of development. The hyperparameters,\nparticularly the learning rate, played a significant role in\nmodel performance, with lower learning rates improving test\naccuracy. Fig. 12\nB. Predicting a larger window size for the future\nWe expanded our experiment to predict larger future win-\ndow sizes using Simple GAN and Fully Quantum GAN.\nThe results show that FQGAN performs better with smaller\nFig. 10. Full Quantum GAN. Train (up) and test (down).\ndatasets, even with larger window sizes, indicating the model’s\nability to generalize effectively with fewer data points.\nFrom Fig 14, we can observe the values of RMSE, MAE\nand R2 scores. The metric values are consistently lower for\nthe FQGAN relative to the simple GAN. As we increase the\npast and future window sizes, the size of the dataset decreases.\nFor example, with a window size of (4,2) (past window, future\nwindow), there are nearly 1500 data points; however, with a\nwindow size of (32, 16), it reduces to 194. From the figure, it\nis evident that the FQGAN can perform better than Classical\nGAN even with fewer data points to train on.\n1) Quantum Circuit Resource Usage: From Eq. 1, we can\ncalculate the number of qubits required by the FQGAN circuit.\nThe depth of the circuit scales exponentially because we\nuse Amplitude Embedding for encoding the data. One way\nto reduce the depth of the circuit is to use efficient data\nembedding schemes. [21] proposes a parallel amplitude em-\nbedding method which can reduce the depth of the amplitude\nembedding circuit by 25% for more than 10 qubits [22]. Fig.\n13\nFig. 11. RMSE for the models across varying past window sizes\nFig. 12. From AWS SV1, 3 epochs (up) and 2 epochs (down).\nVI. IMPROVEMENT\nThe potential of quantum computing in the financial services\nindustry is both substantial and transformative. Quantum al-\ngorithms, particularly those designed for predictive modeling,\ncan significantly enhance the accuracy and efficiency of stock\nprice forecasting. By processing vast amounts of market data,\nincluding historical prices, trading volumes, and economic\nindicators, Quantum Machine Learning (QML) models possess\nthe ability to identify complex patterns that may remain elusive\nFig. 13.\nNumber of qubits (left), circuit depth (middle) and number of trainable parameters (right) for fully quantum GAN. The x-axis has the different\nwindow sizes.\nto classical machine learning algorithms.\nIn this context, our proposed solution—employing Quan-\ntum Generative Adversarial Networks (QGANs) for stock\nprice prediction—represents a significant advancement in the\nfield. Through the integration of quantum computing, we\nhave achieved a quantum advantage over traditional methods,\nparticularly in terms of the ability to predict stock prices\nwith smaller datasets. The novel approach of utilizing both a\nquantum generator and a quantum discriminator has proven in-\nstrumental in enhancing model performance, yielding superior\npredictive outcomes compared to classical counterparts. This\nbreakthrough has far-reaching implications for fund managers,\nproviding them with highly accurate price predictions that\ncan inform and optimize investment decisions. By enabling\nmore precise stock price forecasts, fund managers are better\nequipped to refine their investment strategies, mitigate risks,\nand ultimately maximize returns.\nOur work emphasizes the use of quantum computing to\nrefine prediction accuracy, empowering fund managers to\nmake data-driven, informed decisions and optimize portfolio\nperformance across various time horizons. By integrating\nquantum-powered price predictions for both market indices\nand individual stocks, we enable investors to construct port-\nfolios that not only minimize potential risks but also generate\nsuperior returns. Additionally, our contributions to individual\nstock analysis have significantly enhanced fund management\ncapabilities, allowing financial institutions to provide clients\nwith more effective and tailored investment strategies.\nBeyond improving decision-making processes, our approach\nalso strengthens portfolio performance and risk management\nstrategies. By providing accurate stock price forecasts and en-\nabling insightful portfolio analysis, we facilitate a more strate-\ngic investment approach. Leveraging state-of-the-art quantum\ncomputing technologies, our methodology empowers secu-\nrities departments to adopt a forward-looking approach to\ntrading decisions, ensuring optimal returns for clients and\nenhancing overall financial outcomes.

CONCLUSION\nThis research provides a comprehensive exploration of\nthe application of Quantum Generative Adversarial Networks\n(QGANs) for stock index price forecasting, making a sig-\nnificant contribution to the emerging field of Quantum Fi-\nnance. Through a comparative analysis of classical GANs,\nhybrid quantum-classical GANs, and fully quantum GANs, we\nhighlight the superior performance of quantum-based models\nrelative to conventional forecasting techniques.\nEmpirical results consistently demonstrate that quantum-\nenhanced models, particularly fully Quantum GANs, outper-\nform classical methodologies such as ARIMA, LSTM, and\ntraditional GANs in terms of both accuracy and computational\nefficiency. The observed advantage is largely attributed to the\nunique quantum properties of superposition and entanglement,\nwhich enable these models to process and analyze complex,\nhigh-dimensional data more effectively than their classical\ncounterparts.

Core Content and Key Contributions\n\nThis paper systematically investigates the **application of Quantum Generative Adversarial Networks (QGANs) to stock index price prediction**, representing a cutting-edge exploration in the field of quantum finance. The core content and major contributions are as follows:\n\n### Core Content\n- **Proposes and implements a QGAN model for stock price forecasting**: The authors design and realize a complete technical pipeline—from classical GANs, through hybrid quantum-classical GANs, to fully quantum GANs (Fully Quantum GAN, FQGAN).\n- **Validates the model using real market data**: Based on 10 years of historical FTSE stock index data, they train QGAN circuits on the AWS Braket SV1 quantum simulator and evaluate performance.\n- **Conducts comparative analysis across models**: Using metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and R², the study compares prediction accuracy and convergence speed among traditional LSTM, classical GAN, hybrid QGAN, and fully quantum QGAN.\n\n### Key Contributions\n1. **First implementation of a \"fully quantum GAN\" architecture for financial time series forecasting**:\n   - Employs a **Variational Quantum Circuit (VQC)** as the generator;\n   - Introduces the **SWAP test as a fully quantum discriminator**, eliminating the need for parameter training by leveraging quantum state fidelity to distinguish real from fake data;\n   - Achieves a truly end-to-end quantum-native GAN structure.\n\n2. **Proposes an innovative \"Invertible Fully Quantum GAN\" (Invertible FQGAN)**:\n   - Addresses the challenge in quantum models where normalization prevents recovery of actual price values;\n   - Innovatively adopts an “overlapping window training + optimized solving of normalization factors” strategy, enabling accurate restoration of original price scales during testing.\n\n3. **Reveals advantages of quantum models in small-data scenarios**:\n   - Experiments show that FQGAN maintains strong generalization ability even with limited training data, outperforming classical GANs—demonstrating the potential for high data efficiency in quantum learning.\n\n4. **Provides a comprehensive quantum financial modeling workflow**:\n   - Offers practical guidance across the full pipeline: data preprocessing (Hodrick-Prescott filtering, min-max scaling), amplitude encoding, window-length design, and denormalization.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Breakthroughs and Innovations\n\nThe paper achieves significant advances in theoretical architecture, technical implementation, and practical application:\n\n| Innovation Dimension | Specific Innovation |\n|----------------------|---------------------|\n| **Architectural Innovation** | Proposes the first fully quantum GAN framework (FQGAN), replacing traditional neural network discriminators with the SWAP test—avoiding parameter training and enhancing quantum-native characteristics |\n| **Algorithmic Innovation** | Designs \"Invertible FQGAN\", using an input-output overlapping mechanism to automatically derive normalization coefficients, overcoming a key bottleneck in quantum models' inability to recover real-world values |\n| **Encoding Optimization** | Combines angle encoding and amplitude embedding depending on window size, balancing resource consumption and expressive power |\n| **Resource Analysis Model** | Derives a mathematical formula for qubit count relative to past/future window lengths: <br> $ \\lceil\\log_2 b\\rceil + \\lceil\\log_2 f\\rceil + 1 $, providing guidance for hardware deployment |\n| **Empirical Discovery** | Finds that FQGAN performs better with smaller datasets, suggesting quantum models may possess superior few-shot learning capabilities—significant for high-frequency trading and emerging market forecasting |\n\nAdditionally, despite current limitations in quantum hardware (execution only feasible on the SV1 simulator, ~2 hours per training round), the authors conducted multiple comparative experiments, demonstrating rigorous research methodology and practical engineering awareness.\n\n---\n\n## 3.
