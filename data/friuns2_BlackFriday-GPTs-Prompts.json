    "summary": "# Project Summary\n\n## 1. Core Content and Main Problems Solved\nThe core of this project is to provide a free list of GPT tools that can be used without subscribing to premium services, covering various fields such as programming, marketing, academic research, job hunting, game development, creative generation, prompt engineering, business applications, and productivity/lifestyle optimization. It aims to address the issue of high subscription costs that users may face when using advanced AI tools, allowing a broader user base to leverage these powerful AI functionalities to enhance efficiency and creativity.\n\n## 2. Breakthroughs or Innovations\n- **Free Access to High-End AI Features**: This project breaks the traditional barrier where one must pay to enjoy high-quality AI services, enabling more people to access cutting-edge technology on an equal footing.\n- **Comprehensive Coverage Across Multiple Domains**: From programming to creative writing and practical work scenarios (e.g., the virtual engineer Devin), the project supports an extremely wide range of application scenarios.\n- **Combination of Autonomy and Collaboration**: Taking Devin as an example, it demonstrates how AI can not only serve as an assistant but also independently complete tasks, showcasing high intelligence and flexibility.\n- **Mobile-First Philosophy**: As seen in the demo videos, the project emphasizes the importance of mobile applications, catering to the needs of modern fast-paced lifestyles.\n\n## 3. Good Ideas for Entrepreneurial Projects\nBased on this project, here are some suitable directions for entrepreneurship:\n- **Personalized Education Platform**: Use these free GPT resources to provide students with customized learning plans, adjusting teaching content across different subjects based on individual progress.\n- **Intelligent Workplace Assistant App**: Develop an app integrating the various GPT functions mentioned above to help professionals improve their work efficiency, such as automatically generating reports or optimizing resumes.\n- **Automated Software Development Service**: Leverage fully autonomous AI engineers like Devin to start a company focused on rapid prototyping and small project implementation, lowering the technical threshold for startups.\n- **Cross-Cultural Exchange Promoter**: Use relevant language processing models to build a platform that facilitates communication among global users, removing language barriers while sharing cultural differences.\n- **Interactive Entertainment Content Creation**: Combine gaming and creative generation modules to create new narrative-based interactive story experiences, attracting younger consumers to participate.",
