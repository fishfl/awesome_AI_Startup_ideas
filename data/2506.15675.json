Discover. — Mark Twain\nWorld exploration and interaction form the foundation of humankind’s odyssey, which are practical\nscenarios for world generation models [1]. These models aim to adhere to the world laws (real world\nor games) while facilitating unrestricted exploration and interaction within environments. In this\npaper, we focus on the first act of world generation—world exploration, which aims to use image,\ntext, or video to construct a dynamic and realistic world for interactive and unrestricted exploration.\nRecent advancements in video generation [2, 3, 4, 5, 6] have been remarkable, making it a promising\napproach for world generation through video generation. Meanwhile, camera-controlled video\ngeneration [7, 8, 9] is a suitable way for world exploration, since camera trajectories can be converted\n§This work was done during the internship at Shanghai AI Laboratory.\n*Equal contribution.\n†Corresponding authors: wuyuwei@bit.edu.cn; lichuanhao@pjlab.org.cn; zhangkaipeng@pjlab.org.cn\n‡Project leader.\nPreprint.

However, generating long and realistic videos with precise camera\ncontrol remains a significant challenge. Data is a critical challenge. Existing video generation\ndatasets [10, 11, 12] are not well-suited for world exploration as they suffer from limitations: limited\nlocations, short duration, static scenes, and a lack of annotations about exploration (e.g., camera\ntrajectories) and world annotations (e.g., location, weather and scene).\nIn this paper, we introduce\nSEKAI (せかい, meaning “world” in Japanese), a high-quality\negocentric worldwide video dataset for world exploration (see Figure 1 and Figure 2). Most videos\ncontain audio for an immersive world generation. It also benefits other applications, such as video\nunderstanding, navigation, and video-audio co-generation. Sekai-Real comprises over 5000 hours\nof videos collected from YouTube Å with high-quality annotations. Sekai-Game comprises videos\nfrom a realistic video game s, Lushfoil Photography Sim, with ground-truth annotations. It has five\ndistinct features: (1) High-quality and diverse video. All videos are recorded in 720p at 30 FPS,\nfeaturing diverse weather conditions, various times, and dynamic scenes. (2) Worldwide location.\nVideos are captured across 101 countries and regions, featuring over 750 cities with diverse cultures,\nactivities, architectures, and landscapes. (3) Walking and drone view. Beyond the walking videos\n(e.g., citywalk and hiking), Seikai contains drone view (FPV and UAV) videos for unrestricted world\nexploration. (4) Long duration. All walking videos are at least 60 seconds long, ensuring real-world,\nlong-term world exploration. (5) Rich annotations. All videos are annotated with location, scene,\nweather, crowd density, captions, and camera trajectories. YouTube videos’ annotations are of high\nquality, while annotations from the game are considered ground truth.\nTo construct the Sekai dataset, we develop a curation pipeline (see Section 3) for Sekai-Real (YouTube\nvideos) and Sekai-Game (video game videos). (1) For Sekai-Real Å, we first manually search and\ndownload high-quality walking and drone videos. Then we introduce a pre-processing pipeline to\nobtain video clips by shot detection, video transcoding, and quality evaluation. After that, we develop\nan annotation framework to annotate location, scene type, weather, crowd density, captions, and\ncamera trajectories. Considering the large amount of data and practical usage, we further introduce\na video sampling module to sample the best-of-the-best videos according to the computational\nresources for training the video generation model. (2) For the Sekai-Game s, we first play Lushfoil\nPhotography Sim and record videos. Then we use the same pre-processing pipeline to obtain video\nclips. For the annotation, we develop a toolbox to record ground-truth annotations while playing.\nWe do dataset statistics analysis to show the scale and diversity of the dataset. And, we validate the\naccuracy of annotations for YouTube videos. Besides, we use a subset of the Sekai-Real to train an\ninteractive video world exploration model, named YUME (ゆめ, meaning “dream” in Japanese).\nThe main contribution of this work is the dataset, Sekai. It is a high-quality long-form video dataset for\nworldwide exploration by walking or drone. We annotate diverse labels, including captions, location,\nscene, weather, crowd density, time-of-day, and camera trajectories for each video. Experiments\ndemonstrate the effectiveness and the quality of the dataset. We believe Sekai will benefit the\nareas of video generation and world generation, and motivate valuable applications. We provide an\nintroduction video on the project page.\n2\nFigure 2: An overview of the Sekai dataset. Sekai-Real is collected from YouTube with high-quality\nannotations, while Sekai-Game is collected from a game with ground-truth annotations.\n2\nRelated Work\n2.1\nWorld Generation Model\nRecent years have seen a growing interest in video generation [2, 6, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17], 3D scene gen-\neration [18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23], and 4D generation [24, 25, 26, 27, 28], with significant advancements\nopening up new possibilities in the development of world generation models [29, 30, 31, 32, 33]. In\nthe realm of video generation, text-to-video generation [14, 15] has played a pivotal role, achieving\nhigh-fidelity results, while image-to-video generation [16, 17, 34] has also seen notable advance-\nments. Sora [29] further underscores the significance of video generation in the context of world\ngeneration models. Among 3D scene generation methods, techniques [20, 21, 22, 18] utilize depth\nestimation models [35, 36, 37] to extend 2D scenes into 3D representations. 4D scene genera-\ntion [24, 25, 26] further introduces dynamics, focusing on the evolution of objects or scenes over\ntime [27] and dynamic interactions [28]. This paper primarily focuses on interactive video generation\nfor world exploration, aiming to construct a dynamic and realistic world using image, text, or video\nfor unrestricted exploration.\n2.2\nVideo Generation Dataset\nThe continuous development of annotated datasets has played a pivotal role in shaping the land-\nscape of artificial intelligence-generated content, offering both insights and challenges for accurate\nmodel assessment. Existing video generation datasets can be categorized as specific-scenario and\n3\nFigure 3: The dataset curation pipeline. * indicates we annotate trajectories for partial data.\nopen-scenario. Typical specific-scenario datasets including UCF-101 [38], Taichi-HD [39], Sky-\nTimelapse [40], FaceForensics++ [41], ChronoMagic [42] and Celebv-HQ [43]. These datasets\nhave limited amount of data (with a total duration of less than 800 hours), limited individual video\nduration (with an average length of less than 20 seconds), and generally lack annotation informa-\ntion (only a few datasets, such as ChromoMagic, provide caption annotations). Open-scenario\ndatasets [44, 45, 46, 47] have somewhat alleviated issues with data scale and annotation information.\nFor example, OpenSoraPlan-V1.0 [46] includes videos with a total duration of 274 hours, each\naccompanied by detailed captions. Similarly, the recently introduced OpenVid-1M dataset [10]\ncomprises videos totaling 2100 hours, with long captions provided for each video. However, the\naverage duration of individual videos still does not exceed 25 seconds, and they only provide caption\nannotations. MiraData [12] consists of longer videos with an average length of 72.1 seconds. It is\nstill not long enough for the world exploration, and exploration annotations (e.g., camera poses or\nkeyboard and mouse inputs) and world annotations (e.g., location, time and weather) are missing. By\ncontrast, the proposed Sekai dataset focuses on egocentric world exploration, which covers walking\nand drone view videos across diverse locations and scenes with long video duration (1 to 39 minutes,\naverage is 2 minutes) and rich exploratory and world annotation.\n3\nDataset Curation\nThe overall process of curating the Sekai dataset includes four major parts: video collection, pre-\nprocessing, annotation, and sampling, seeing Figure 3 for an illustration.\n3.1\nVideo Collection\nIn the collection stage, we collect over 8623 hours of YouTube videos and over 40 hours of game\nvideos from Lushfoil Photography Sim.\nYouTube. We manually collect high-quality video URLs from popular YouTubers and extend them\nby searching additional videos using related keywords (e.g., walk, drone, HDR, and 4K). In total,\nwe collect 10471 hours of walking videos (with stereo audio) and 628 hours of drone (FPV or UAV)\nvideos. All videos were released over the past three years, with a 30-minute to 12-hour duration.\nThey are at least 1080P with 30 to 60 FPS. We download the 1080P version with the highest Mbps\nfor further video processing and annotation. Due to network issues and some videos are broken, there\nare 8409 hours of walking videos and 214 hours of drone videos after downloading.\nVideo Game. Beyond real-world data, we collect additional data from the video game since its\nground-truth annotations are accessible (e.g., location, weather, and camera trajectory). Lushfoil\n4\nPhotography Sim is a video game that allows walking or using a first-person drone to explore real-\nworld landscapes. It is built by Unreal Engine 5 and showcases the game’s locations in stunning\nvisual fidelity, making it an excellent source for collecting realistic synthetic data. We use OBS\nStudio to record 40 hours videos at 1080P 30FPS (8 to 12 Mbps) with diverse locations and weather.\nScaling the amount of data is low-cost.\n3.2\nVideo Pre-processing\nFor YouTube videos, we trim two minutes from the start and end of each original video to remove\nthe opening and ending. Then we do the following steps and obtain 6620 hours (Sekai-Real) and 60\nhours (Sekai-Game) of video clips for YouTube and the game, respectively.\nShot Boundary Detection. YouTube videos are often cut and stitched, and video games commonly\nfeature teleportation points—both of which contribute to discontinuous shot segments in one video.\nThus, following Cosmos [30], we employ TransNetV2 [48] with a threshold of 0.4 for shot boundary\ndetection. However, the original implementation runs slowly. We refactored the codebase for\nGPU acceleration, which is five times faster than the original version. In particular, we use the\nPyNVideoCodec library for video decoding and employ the CVCUDA library to offload frame\noperations such as color space conversion and histogram computation to the GPU. We trim five\nseconds from the start and end of each shot. After shot detection, the duration of video clips is from 1\nto 5.88 hours.\nClip Extraction and Transcoding. Considering practical processing, we split each shot into multiple\none-minute clips (shorter than one minute will be discarded). In model training, we can stitch\ncontiguous clips according to the computation resources. We re-encode each video clip using the\nPyNVideoCodec library to standardize the diverse codec configurations in the raw videos, targeting\n720p at 30fps in H.265 MP4 format with a bitrate of 4 Mbps. Evaluation of the transcoded video\nclips across diverse scenes yields PSNR values above 35, indicating no perceptible visual degradation.\nWe think the world exploration should contain realistic sound. Thus, we keep the audio of walking\nvideos. We trim the audio tracks based on the timestamps of the video clips, re-encode them into\nAAC format using FFmpeg at 48kHz, and mux each audio clip with its corresponding video clip.\nLuminance Filtering. Overly dark or bright videos are not suitable for model training. We apply a\nsimple filter based on the luma channel in YUV color space, and remove video clips with more than\n15 consecutive frames of extremely high or low average brightness. Especially, this step is necessary\nfor video game data, as the engine often employs simplified lighting and camera systems. In this step,\nwe filter out 300 hours of videos.\nQuality Filtering. We use COVER [49], a comprehensive video quality evaluator to filter low-quality\nvideo clips according to the technical quality metric. Technical quality evaluates issues such as image\nclarity, transmission distortion, and transcoding artifacts. The lowest-scoring 10% of video clips are\nremoved after filtering.\nSubtitle Filtering. Some videos contain hardcoded subtitles, which are artificial texts embedded in\nthe video frames. These subtitles compromise the video’s fidelity to the real world and may introduce\nmisleading patterns during model training. To mitigate this, we apply VideoSubFinder to detect\nhardcoded subtitles on the bottom one-third of the video frames. A clip is flagged if it contains any\nsubtitle that remains visible for more than 0.75 seconds, in order to reduce false positives. All flagged\nclips are removed, resulting in the exclusion of approximately 5% of the video clips.\nCamera Trajectory Filtering. For Sekai-Real, we employ a state-of-the-art structure from motion\n(SfM) model to extract camera trajectories. However, some trajectories exhibit implausible or counter-\nintuitive motions, so we heuristically filter out abnormal cases using the following rules. Specifically,\nwe exclude video clips if they satisfy either of the following: (1) Multiple abrupt trajectory reversals\n(i.e., directional changes exceeding 150 degrees) within a 10-second window. (2) A camera viewpoint\nshift greater than 60 degrees between two consecutive frames. (3) A camera position displacement\ngreater than 5 times the average displacement of the 30 consecutive frames containing these two\nframes. This filtering phase is only conducted for partial data annotated with camera trajectories.\n3.3\nVideo Annotation of Sekai-Real\nWe annotate video clips using large vision-language models.\n5\nLocation. Utilizing the Google YouTube Data API, we fetch the title and description of each\nvideo. Since most videos contain multiple chapters filmed at different locations with timeline-based\ndescriptions, we employ GPT-4o [50] to extract a formatted location for each chapter with the ISO\n3166 country/region code attached for subsequent processing. We use the interval tree to efficiently\nmatch each video clip to its corresponding chapter based on the timestamp, thereby retrieving the\nlocation information. Video clips that cannot be uniquely matched to a chapter are discarded, which\naccounts for approximately 8% of the total clips.\nCategory and Caption. We adopt a two-stage strategy to annotate each video with category and\ncaption. In the first stage, the video is classified along four orthogonal dimensions: scene type,\nweather, time of day, and crowd density, each with mutually exclusive labels. The model selects the\nmost suitable label for each and abstains when uncertain. In the second stage, we carefully design\nprompts that incorporate the predicted category labels, location information, and video frames to\ngenerate detailed, time-ordered descriptions of actions and scenes for each video clip. Practically, we\nextract one frame every two seconds from each video clip and use 72B version of Qwen2.5-VL [51]\nto annotate them. We deploy vLLM [52] inference services with Nginx [53] for load balance. The\nfinal caption length averages over 176 words per video clip.\nCamera Trajectories. We experimented with various camera trajectory annotation methods of\ndifferent types, including the visual odometry method DPVO [54], the deep visual SLAM framework\nMegaSaM [35], and a carefully designed 3D transformer VGGT [55] that outputs 3D quantities.\nThrough empirical experiments and comparisons, we chose MegaSaM as the baseline annotation\nmethod and made adjustments to optimize annotation accuracy and efficiency. First, we replaced\nthe monocular depth estimation model Depth Anything [56] used in MegaSaM with Video Depth\nAnything [36], which performs better in terms of temporal consistency. We also tried modifying\nthe metric depth estimation model in MegaSaM by replacing UniDepth [37] with DepthPro [57].\nAdditionally, we optimized the official implementation of MegaSaM to support cross-machine, multi-\nGPU parallel inference, significantly improving annotation efficiency. We annotate over 600 hours of\nvideos (after the sampling).\n3.4\nVideo Annotation of Sekai-Game\nWe developed a concise yet comprehensive toolchain based on the open-source tools RE-UE4SS and\nOBS Studio to capture ground-truth annotations from video games. RE-UE4SS is a powerful script\nsystem for Unreal Engine, enabling access and modification of the UE object system with minimal\noverhead at runtime. Based on its Lua Scripting API, we develop practical tools for video collection\nand annotation, including the standardization of camera system configuration, real-time camera pose\ncapture, GUI hiding, ensuring the collection of clean data with aligned annotations.\nThe location and category are obtained from the description of the game map, and the prompt used\nfor captioning is tightly modified to better suit the video game context. For camera trajectories, the\ncaptured camera poses are further calibrated to compensate for delays and interpolated to synchronize\nwith the video frames.\n3.5\nVideo Sampling\nGiven the prohibitive cost of training on the full Sekai-Real, we propose a strategy to sample the best\nof the best clips with the highest quality and diversity. The number is related to the computational\nbudget for further video generation model training. In this paper, we sample 400 hours of the best of\nthe best videos as Sekai-Real-HQ.\n3.5.1\nQuality Sampling\nWe sample the highest-quality clips according to two aspects: aesthetic quality and semantic quality.\nAesthetic quality reflects the visual harmony among different elements in the video. Semantic quality\nassesses the semantic completeness and consistency of the content. We use COVER [49] to obtain\ntwo quality scores and sum them for each video clip. We sample a 𝛼𝑞𝑢𝑎𝑙𝑖𝑡𝑦= 0.7 proportion of video\nclips with the highest scores.\n6\n3.5.2\nDiversity Sampling\nWe balance the videos using the following modules one by one. And for Sekai-Real-HQ, the sampling\nratio 𝛼𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑛𝑡, 𝛼𝑙𝑜𝑐, 𝛼𝑐𝑎𝑡𝑒, 𝛼𝑐𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑟𝑎are equal to 70%, 60%, 60%, and 75%, respectivelty.\nContent Diversity. Given the vast volume of video clips, the presence of similar video clips is\ninevitable. We use InternVideo2 [58] to extract embeddings for each video clip, and apply mini batch\nK-Means [59] to cluster the embeddings of each countryregion. Subsequently, in each cluster, we\nuse the scores in quality sampling to rank the samples. Then we iteratively sample a video clip and\nremove its most similar one until 1 −𝛼𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑛𝑡proportion of video clips have been removed.\nLocation Diversity. We denote the number of cities as 𝑁𝑐. For each city, we count the number of\nvideo clips as 𝑁. Given a sampling ratio 𝛼𝑙𝑜𝑐, we sort the cities in ascending order based on their\n𝑁. For each city in this order, we sample approximately 𝑁· 𝛼𝑙𝑜𝑐/𝑁videos from each city. If it is\nlarger than the corresponding 𝑁, we sample all video clips for this city and redistribute the shortfall\nproportionally across the remaining cities by updating 𝛼𝑙𝑜𝑐.\nCategory Diversity. To ensure broad coverage across semantic categories, we perform inverse-\nprobability weighted sampling based on four independent categories: weather, scene, time of day,\nand crowd density. For each category, we compute the frequency of each label and assign sampling\nprobabilities inversely proportional to their frequencies. Assuming independence among categories,\nthe sampling probability for a video is initialized as the product of its label probabilities across the\nfour categories. These probabilities are then normalized to sum to 1. We perform non-replacement\nsampling according to these probabilities until 𝛼𝑐𝑎𝑡𝑒proportion of video clips have been sampled.\nCamera Trajectory Diversity. We perform trajectory-aware sampling by the following steps. First,\nfor the remaining videos, we calculate a direction vector (from the start to end of the trajectory) and\nthe overall jitter, defined as the Euclidean norm of positional variance computed every 30 frames.\nNext, direction vectors are discretized into bins mapped onto a sphere, and jitter values are also\ndiscretized into bins. Then, a joint grouping is formed based on the direction and jitter bins. Finally,\nwe do average sampling in each joint group according to the sampling ratio 𝛼𝑐𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑟𝑎.\n4\nDataset Statistics\nOutdoor-\nNatural\n101 \nCountry/\nRegion\n4 Time\n…\nJapan\nSunrise/Sunset\nDay\nModerate\nScattered\nBustling\nEmpty\nCrowded\nNight\nIndoor\nUnknown\nFigure 4: Statistical information on five dimen-\nsions of the Sekai-Real dataset.\nFor the Sekai-Game collection, we have considered\nthe data balance issue while playing the game. Fig-\nure 4 provides an overview of the statistical infor-\nmation of the Sekai-Real dataset. Overall, the Sekai-\nReal dataset includes 101 countries and regions, with\nthe video durations exhibiting a distinct long-tail dis-\ntribution. The top eight countries (such as the Japan,\nthe United States, and the United Kingdom) account\nfor approximately 60% of the total duration. From\nvarious perspectives, we categorize the Sekai-Real\ndataset into four weather types, four scene types,\nfour time-of-day categories, and five levels of crowd\ndensity. Specifically, the majority of the videos were\noutdoors. For outdoor videos, the weather condi-\ntions are predominantly sunny and cloudy, and the\ndataset also includes unique weather situations, such\nas rain and snow, increasing the diversity of the\ndataset. Regarding the time of filming, most videos\nwere shot during the daytime, followed by nighttime footage. This provides a mix of well-lit scenes\nunder natural light and darker scenes with artificial lighting, offering diverse challenges for model\nlearning. In terms of crowd density, the distribution is relatively uniform, ranging from the sparsely\npopulated forests of Finland to the bustling streets of Japan. This stepwise distribution covers a variety\nof crowd density scenarios, providing diverse training settings for the model, such as curriculum\nlearning and evaluation of video generation models under varying levels of crowd density.\nThe statistics of Sekai-Real and Sekai-Real-HQ across multiple dimensions are shown in Figure 5.\nSekai-Real-HQ is the best of the best subset of Sekai-Real, and with more balanced data distribution.\n7\n0.15\n0.40\n0.65\n0.90\n1.15\n1.40\n0\n1\n2\n3\nPercentage (%)\nSekai-Real\nSekai-Real-HQ\n(a) Overall Video Quality Score\n22%\n21%\n17%\n5%\n4% 4% 4%4%\nSekai-Real\n14%\n13%\n13%\n5%\n9%\n6%\n4%\nSekai-Real-HQ\nUnited States\nJapan\nUnited Kingdom\nThe Emirates\nKorea\nFrance\nItaly\nChina\nGermany\nCanada\n(b) Location Distribution\n50\n100\n150\n200\n250\n300\n350\n0.000\n0.005\n0.010\n0.015\n0.020\nPercentage (%)\nOpenVid-1M\nSekai-Real\n(c) Caption Tokens Distribution\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\nPercentage (%)\nSubset of Sekai-Real\nSekai-Real-HQ\n(d) Camera Trajectory Jitter Distribution\nFigure 5: Statistics of the proposed Sekai-Real and Sekai-Real-HQ dataset.\nSeeing Figure 5 (a), Sekai-Real demonstrates strong overall video quality scores, with more than half\nof the videos scoring above 0.9, while Sekai-Real-HQ exhibits a higher mean video quality score\nand a lower variance to address the long-tail distribution issue. Figure 5 (b) shows the distribution of\nSekai-Real’s locations. Both Sekai-Real and Sekai-Real-HQ cover a wide range of countries globally.\nSekai-Real-HQ demonstrates a more balanced distribution, which is more effective in mitigating\npotential bias during model training. Figure 5 (c) shows the distribution of caption token counts\nin Sekai-Real and OpenVid-1M. It can be observed that the average number of caption tokens in\nSekai-Real exceeds 200, which is significantly higher than OpenVid-1M’s average of around 130.\nFigure 5 (d) shows the distribution of camera trajectory jitter values before and after applying Camera\nTrajectory Diversity. We can observe that the distribution for Sekai-Real-HQ is smoother compared\nto that of the Subset of Sekai-Real (500 hours, before applying Camera Trajectory Diversity). This\nindicates that Sekai-Real-HQ achieves better diversity and a more uniform distribution.\n5\nYUME Model\nw\nS\nA\nD\nw\nS\nA\nD\nw\nS\nA\nD\nw\nS\nA\nD\nw\nS\nA\nD\nw\nS\nA\nD\nw\nS\nA\nD\nw\nS\nA\nD\nw\nS\nA\nD\nw\nS\nA\nD\nw\nS\nA\nD\nw\nS\nA\nD\nFigure 6: Examples of videos generated by YUME using keyboard and mouse control.\nWe train an interactive world exploration model named YUME (ゆめ, meaning “dream” in Japanese)\nusing a subset of the Sekai-Real-HQ.

It consists of over 5,000 hours of walking or drone view (FPV and UVA) videos from\n101 countries and over 750 cities. We develop an efficient and effective toolchain to pre-process and\nannotate videos. For each video, we annotate location, scene type, weather, crowd density, captions,\nand camera trajectories. Besides, we introduce a video sampling module to sample the best of the\nbest videos according to the model training budget. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and\nthe quality of the dataset. We believe Sekai will benefit the area of video world generation and raise\nvaluable applications.\n7\nLimitation\nInsufficient training. Due to the limited computational resources, we use only a small proportion of\nSekai-Real-HQ in model training.\nInsufficient camera trajectory annotation. Due to our limited computational resources, for Sekai-\nReal, we annotate camera trajectories only for partial data.\nReferences\n[1] Haoyi Duan, Hong-Xing Yu, Sirui Chen, Li Fei-Fei, and Jiajun Wu.

    "content": "# Paper Analysis: Sekai: A Video Dataset towards World Exploration\n\n## 1. Core Content and Major Contributions\nThe core content of this paper introduces **Sekai**, a high-quality first-person view (FPV) global video dataset designed to advance world exploration technologies based on video generation. The Sekai dataset includes over 5,000 hours of walking or drone-perspective videos, covering 101 countries and more than 750 cities worldwide. It provides rich annotation information, including location, scene type, weather, crowd density, subtitles, and camera trajectories.\n\nThe main contributions are as follows:\n- **Large-scale High-Quality Dataset**: Sekai is a comprehensive long-video dataset that spans the globe, addressing limitations in existing video generation datasets such as restricted locations, short video durations, static scenes, and lack of exploration-related annotations.\n- **Rich Annotations**: In addition to basic video content, Sekai provides various annotations, such as location, scene, weather, crowd density, subtitles, and camera trajectories, offering full support for world exploration tasks.\n- **Innovative Collection and Preprocessing Methods**: The research team developed an efficient toolchain for collecting, preprocessing, and annotating videos, ensuring the quality and diversity of the dataset.\n- **Subset Model Validation**: Using a subset of the Sekai dataset, an interactive video world exploration model named YUME (meaning \"dream\" in Japanese) was trained, demonstrating the dataset's potential in practical applications.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Breakthroughs and Innovations\nThis paper showcases breakthroughs and innovations in the following areas:\n- **Global Video Data**: The Sekai dataset not only covers multiple locations but also focuses on the diversity of different cultures, activities, architectural styles, and landscapes, making it the first truly globalized world exploration dataset.\n- **Long-duration Video Support**: Compared to other datasets, Sekai contains videos ranging from 1 minute to 39 minutes in length, with an average duration of 2 minutes, better simulating the real-world long-term exploration process.\n- **Multimodal Annotations**: In addition to traditional scene and weather annotations, Sekai introduces camera trajectory annotations, which are crucial for interactive video generation tasks.\n- **Combination of Gaming and Reality**: By integrating data from YouTube and a realistic game (Lushfoil Photography Sim), Sekai offers a richer visual experience while ensuring the authenticity and accuracy of some annotations.\n- **Efficient Data Screening Method**: A sampling strategy based on quality scores and diversity was proposed, enabling the selection of the optimal subset (Sekai-Real-HQ) from massive amounts of data, effectively reducing training costs and enhancing model performance.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Entrepreneurial Project Inspiration\nUsing the Sekai dataset as a core resource, many commercially valuable entrepreneurial projects can be derived. Below are some specific creative directions:\n\n### 3.1 Virtual Travel Platform\nBuild a virtual travel platform using the Sekai dataset, allowing users to explore scenic spots around the world in real-time by controlling the camera with their keyboard and mouse. This immersive experience can attract users interested in travel who cannot physically visit these places.\n\n### 3.2 Educational and Training Tools\nApply the Sekai dataset in the education field to develop interactive courses for geography, history, and cultural learning. For example, students can learn about the cultural backgrounds and natural landscapes of different countries through videos with detailed annotations.\n\n### 3.3 Autonomous Driving Simulation Environment\nUse the walking and drone-perspective videos in the Sekai dataset to train autonomous driving systems, particularly enhancing navigation capabilities in complex urban environments. Additionally, camera trajectory annotations can help optimize vehicle motion planning algorithms.\n\n### 3.4 Urban Planning and Design Assistance\nAnalyze urban areas in the Sekai dataset to extract information on pedestrian distribution, traffic conditions, and building design, providing decision support for urban planners.\n\n### 3.5 AI Director Assistant\nDevelop an AI director assistant tool based on the Sekai dataset to help filmmakers quickly generate lens scripts for specific scenes. By entering keywords (such as \"city streets at dawn\" or \"rainy park\"), AI can recommend matching video clips and shooting angles.\n\n### 3.6 Game Development Resource Library\nThe high-quality videos and annotations in the Sekai dataset can serve as reference materials for game development, especially suitable for open-world game designs. Developers can generate more realistic virtual environments based on real-world scenes.\n\n---\n\nThe above is an analysis and interpretation of this paper, hoping it will be helpful to you!",
