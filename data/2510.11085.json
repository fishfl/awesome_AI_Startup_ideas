INTRODUCTION\nSince the beginning of the 21st century, the rapid evolution of\ngenerative artificial intelligence (AI) and autonomous intelli-\ngent agents (AI agents) has profoundly reshaped the operating\nmechanisms of socioeconomic systems. Overall, the United\nStates maintains a significant lead in core model development\nand capital investment. Public data indicate that in 2023, the\nU.S. launched 109 representative foundation models—far ex-\nceeding China’s 20 models [1]. In the same year, private-\nsector AI investment in the U.S. reached USD 67.2 billion,\ncompared with China’s USD 7.8 billion [2]. Furthermore,\nthe United States possesses a far more extensive computing\ninfrastructure, with 5,381 data centers compared to approx-\nimately 449 in China [3], providing a more stable founda-\ntion for large-scale model training and inference. In contrast,\nChina has promoted the rapid diffusion of AI applications\nthrough centralized implementation and deployment mecha-\nnisms. The proportion of enterprises that regularly use gen-\nerative AI (83%) surpasses that of the United States (65%),\nthough China still slightly lags behind in ”deep implemen-\ntation”—that is, end-to-end automation and process reengi-\nneering (19% vs. 24%)[4]. This contrast underscores a cru-\ncial conclusion: China leads in the breadth of AI application,\nwhile the United States holds the advantage in depth of tech-\nnology and ecosystem maturity.\nAgainst this backdrop, there is an urgent need to system-\natically assess the differing impacts of intelligent agents on\nsocioeconomic output across the two countries, taking into\naccount their distinct national contexts. Existing research has\npreliminarily confirmed that the introduction of AI agents en-\nhances both micro-level productivity and macro-level wel-\nfare. However, quantitative analyses comparing China and\nthe United States remain limited.\nOn one hand, China’s vast labor force—approximately\n770 million people [5]—and substantial capital accumulation\n[6] provide the scale and data availability necessary for large-\nscale agent collaboration and autonomous production.\nOn\nthe other hand, the United States’ first-mover advantages in\ncomputing power, algorithms, and business models [7],[8]\nmay enable it to enter a ”virtuous cycle” of agent adoption\n→network effects →productivity growth earlier.\nConse-\nquently, these structural asymmetries are likely to shape how\nAI contributes to aggregate output in each country. Key ques-\ntions arise: To what extent can AI, as a tool for collabora-\ntive enhancement, improve human labor efficiency in each\ncontext? How much incremental value can it generate as an\nautonomous productive entity? And will network externali-\nties among agents manifest differently between China and the\nUnited States? Clarifying these issues is vital for formulating\ntargeted AI development policies and unlocking the potential\nof the intelligent economy.\nThis paper proposes a comparative analysis based on five\nprogressive intelligent-agent economic model frameworks\nto evaluate the output performance of China and the United\nStates following AI-agent integration. The structure of the\npaper is as follows: Section II reviews the existing litera-\nture; Section III outlines the model construction and explains\nparameter settings; Section IV presents simulation results\narXiv:2510.11085v1  [cs.AI]  13 Oct 2025\nfor both countries under different models, emphasizing how\ndifferences in population size, total resources, AI efficiency\nand penetration, and network effects shape the outcomes;\nSection V discusses the underlying mechanisms and analyzes\nChina’s potential for accelerated improvement; Section VI\noffers policy recommendations and future outlooks.\nThrough this framework, the study aims to uncover: (1)\nthe extent to which intelligent-agent collaboration enhances\noutput in each country and which structural parameters drive\nthis effect; (2) the relative strength of mechanisms such as\ncollaborative enhancement, autonomous production, and net-\nwork externalities; (3) which modes of AI-agent integration\nbest suit the national conditions and development stages of\nChina and the U.S.; and (4) which policy levers can be ad-\njusted to further unleash AI’s potential.\n2. RELATED WORK\nThe evolution of artificial intelligence is commonly under-\nstood as being driven by the synergistic advancement of three\nfundamental pillars—computing power, algorithms, and data\n[9]. This triadic framework has become a core analytical lens\nin both academic and policy discussions of AI development.\nAgainst this backdrop, the present study examines the diver-\ngent trajectories of China and the United States across four in-\nterrelated dimensions: computing infrastructure, models and\nalgorithms, scientific and knowledge output, and application\nand commercialization. On this basis, it further identifies key\nresearch gaps in the existing literature.\nComputing Power. A growing body of studies and industry\nreports suggests that the pace and ceiling of AI iteration are\nlargely constrained by the availability of computing resources\n[10]. The United States has long maintained a leading posi-\ntion in high-end GPU manufacturing [7], the scale of data\ncenters [3], and network infrastructure [11], providing robust\nhardware support and enabling large-scale model training. In\ncontrast, China continues to face bottlenecks in advanced chip\nfabrication and semiconductor processes [12],[13], limiting\nthe overall maturity of its hardware ecosystem.\nHowever,\nChina’s position in the field of intelligent computing power\nis not entirely subordinate. According to a white paper by the\nChina Academy of Information and Communications Tech-\nnology (CAICT), China accounts for approximately 39% of\nglobal intelligent computing capacity, compared with 31%\nfor the United States [14]. This indicates that China already\npossesses notable advantages in the total volume and engi-\nneering deployment of AI-oriented computational resources,\nwith substantial potential for optimization and coordinated\nscheduling.\nModels and Algorithms. The performance gap between Chi-\nnese and American AI models is narrowing rapidly. Based\non the MMLU (Massive Multitask Language Understanding)\nbenchmark, the performance difference between the top mod-\nels of the two countries stood at 17.5 percentage points in\n2023, but had decreased to just 0.3% by early 2024 [8]. This\ntrend demonstrates China’s capacity for swift convergence\nthrough advances in algorithm design, training strategies, and\nengineering optimization.\nScientific Research and Knowledge Output. At the level of\nresearch and knowledge production, the structural divergence\nbetween China and the United States can be characterized\nas a contrast between quantity and breadth versus quality\nand frontier leadership.\nChina ranks first globally in both\npatent applications and academic publication volume, with\nthe number of generative AI–related patent filings over the\npast decade reaching six times that of the United States, re-\nflecting vast research capacity and talent reserves. Yet, in\nterms of citation impact and research influence, the United\nStates maintains a clear advantage.\nFor instance, among\nthe 100 most-cited papers in AI, the U.S. contributed 50,\nwhile China contributed 34, with U.S. papers averaging about\n15% higher citation rates [15].\nThis pattern suggests that\nChina’s research output remains more application-oriented\nand quantity-driven, whereas the United States continues to\ndominate in foundational theory and paradigm innovation.\nApplication and Commercialization. The divergence be-\ntween the two countries is even more pronounced in AI ap-\nplication and commercialization pathways. The U.S. model\ncenters on the consumerization and SaaS-based enterprise de-\nployment of generative AI. By 2024, approximately 68% of\nU.S. enterprises had adopted generative AI—up from 33%\njust one year earlier [16]—and the U.S. AI software and ser-\nvices sector accounts for roughly 60% of the global market\n[17]. China, by contrast, emphasizes industrial integration,\nprocess modularization, and scenario-driven customization.\nIn the manufacturing sector, for example, China’s annual in-\nstallations of industrial robots account for about 52% of the\nglobal total [16], underscoring its distinctive advantage in in-\ndustrial applications. Nevertheless, Chinese AI firms still lag\nbehind in overall profitability. U.S. companies such as Ope-\nnAI generated approximately USD 3.7 billion in revenue in\n2024, with Anthropic reaching USD 0.9 billion [18], reflect-\ning a mature commercial ecosystem. Chinese firms, while\nexhibiting large-scale deployment potential and extensive ap-\nplication coverage, remain smaller in revenue scale and often\ndepend on specific vertical scenarios, with business models\nstill under development.\nSynthesis. Taken together, these dynamics reveal a multi-\ndimensional and evolving landscape rather than a static gap.\nThe United States continues to lead in financial strength, ad-\nvanced chip technology, high-impact research quality, and the\nmaturity of its commercial ecosystem. China, meanwhile,\ndemonstrates robust potential through its rapid progress in\nmodel performance, the scale of research output, and the ex-\npanding domestic application market. Despite a wealth of re-\nsearch on the effects of AI on productivity, employment, and\nindustrial structure—typically focusing on a single country\nor mechanism—there remains a lack of systematic, model-\nbased comparison of the structural and dynamic differences\nbetween China and the United States. To address this gap,\nthis study develops a unified modeling framework to explic-\nitly compare the two nations across key structural parame-\nters, assess the relative strength of different AI-driven mech-\nanisms, and identify actionable policy levers to guide future\ndevelopment pathways for the intelligent economy.\n3. MODELING METHODOLOGY\nTo explore the impact of generative AI agents on socio-\neconomic collaboration, we construct five progressively ex-\ntended models. Model 1 describes a purely human collab-\noration scenario; Model 2 introduces AI agents as collabo-\nrators; Model 3 further incorporates network effects among\nAI agents; Model 4 assumes that AI becomes an independent\nproductive entity sharing resources with humans; Model 5\ncombines features of Models 3 and 4, considering both AI\nindependent production and network synergy. Each model\nreflects varying degrees of human-AI collaboration through\ndifferent mechanisms. The following are the core mathemat-\nical formulations (the derivation process follows prior work\n[19]).\n3.1. Model 1: Pure Human Collaboration Model\nThe total social output depends on population and resource\ninputs:\nY (t) = ϕ0N αR1−α,\n(1)\nwhere Y (t) is the total social output, ϕ0 is the baseline effi-\nciency without AI involvement, N is the human population,\nR is the total amount of resources, and α is the output elastic-\nity of human resources.\n3.2. Model 2: Collaboration Model with AI Agents\nIn this model, total resources R are divided between humans\nand AI agents:\nR = RH + RA,\n(2)\nwhere RH is the portion of resources used by humans, and\nRA is that used by AI agents.\nThe evolution of AI capability is characterized by an S-\nshaped function:\nst =\n1\n1 + e−k(t−t0) ,\n(3)\nwhere k is the growth rate and t0 is the inflection point of\ncapability improvement. The value of st ∈[0, 1] indicates the\nrelative progress of AI technology from its initial to mature\nstage.\nThe total output is given by:\nY (t) = ϕ0N αR1−α\nH\n\"\n1 + γ\n\u0012 RA\nRH\n\u0013β\n(1 + δs(t))β\n#\n,\n(4)\nwhere γ is the baseline coefficient of AI enhancement effi-\nciency and β is the elasticity of AI enhancement.\n3.3. Model 3: AI Collaboration Model with Network Ef-\nfects\nBuilding on Model 2, we incorporate the network externality\nbrought by the number of AI agents A(t):\nY (t) = ϕ0N αR1−α\nH\n\"\n1 + γ\n\u0012 RA\nRH\n\u0013β\n(1 + δs(t))β\n#\n×\n \n1 + η\n\u0012A(t)\nN\n\u00132!\n.\n(5)\nwhere η > 0 represents the maximum amplification magni-\ntude of the network effect.\n3.4. Model 4: AI as an Independent Productive Entity\nLet the share of resources used by AI be defined as:\nω = RA\nR .\n(6)\nThen, the total output function is:\nY (t) = ϕHN α [(1 −ω)R]1−α\n+ ϕAA(t)α [ωR(1 + δs(t))]1−α .\n(7)\nwhere ϕH and ϕA denote the baseline efficiencies of human\nlabor and AI production, respectively.\n3.5. Model 5: Integrated Model with Independent AI\nProduction and Network Effects\nFinally, combining Model 4 with network effects, the total\noutput becomes:\nY (t) = ϕHN α [(1 −ω)R]1−α\n+ ϕAA(t)α [ωR(1 + δs(t))]1−α\n \n1 + η\n\u0012A(t)\nN\n\u00132!\n.\n(8)\n4. SIMULATION ANALYSIS\nBased on the five models described above, we design a com-\nputational simulation experiment to quantitatively analyze the\nimpact of AI agent participation in collaboration on the total\nsocial output in China and the United States.\n4.1. Parameter Settings\n(1) Total Population (N)\nIn 2019, the employed population in China was approx-\nimately 770 million [5], while that in the United States\nwas about 159 million [20]. Thus, the population param-\neters are set as:\nNcn = 7.7 × 108,\nNus = 1.59 × 108.\n(9)\n(2) Total Resources (R)\nThe total resource input is represented by the total capital\nstock. In 2010, China’s total capital stock reached USD\n39.3 trillion, and the U.S. total capital stock was USD 61\ntrillion. In 2019, China’s total capital stock reached USD\n99.6 trillion [6], and the U.S. total capital stock was USD\n69.1 trillion [21]. Therefore:\nR2010,cn = 3.93×1013,\nR2010,us = 6.1×1013. (10)\nR2019,cn = 9.96 × 1013,\nR2019,us = 6.91 × 1013.\n(11)\n(3) Capital Allocation Structure (RH and RA)\nAccording to China Daily (2023), the adoption rate of\ngenerative AI among Chinese enterprises has reached\n15% [22]. We therefore assume that 15% of the total\ncapital is allocated to AI agents and 85% to human labor:\nRA = 0.15R,\nRH = 0.85R.\n(12)\n(4) Labor Output Elasticity (α)\nBased on national statistics, the labor share in 2019 was\n0.58625 for China [23] and 0.59709 for the United States\n[24]. Hence:\nαcn = 0.58625,\nαus = 0.59709.\n(13)\n(5) AI Enhancement Elasticity (β)\nBy 2040, generative AI is projected to increase labor pro-\nductivity by 0.1% to 0.6% per year [25]. To capture the\nstrength of this trend, the elasticity parameter is set as:\nβ = 0.35.\n(14)\n(6) AI Capability Scaling Factor (δ)\nIndustry reports indicate that generative AI can signif-\nicantly enhance efficiency across various business do-\nmains. For example, customer operations may improve\nby approximately 30%–45%, marketing by 5%–15%,\nsales by 3%–5%, and software engineering by 20%–\n45% [25]. These findings suggest that AI exhibits strong\npotential for productivity enhancement in practical appli-\ncations.\nTo reasonably estimate the efficiency gain of AI in the\nmodel while accounting for inter-industry variation and\nreal-world technological penetration, the AI capability\nscaling factor is set to:\nδ = 0.20.\n(15)\nThis value implies that when AI technology reaches ma-\nturity, its resource utilization efficiency can increase by\napproximately 20% over the baseline level.\n(7) Baseline Coefficient of AI Enhancement Efficiency (γ)\nAccording to Google’s experimental studies, software\nengineers using AI-assisted coding tools such as Copilot\nimproved their task completion speed by 55.8% [26].\nBased on this empirical evidence, the baseline coefficient\nis set as:\nγ = 0.55.\n(16)\n(8) AI Capability Level (s(t))\nThe evolution of AI technological capability, denoted as\ns(t), follows a logistic function. The parameters of its\ngrowth rate and inflection point are defined as follows:\n(a) Growth Rate (k)\nFor China, the rate of technological diffusion is cal-\nibrated using the logistic fitting of China’s internet\npenetration between 2001 and 2011, yielding kcn =\n0.38 [27]. In contrast, the organizational adoption\nrate of generative AI in the United States is signifi-\ncantly lower than that of China (approximately 65%\nvs. 83%) [4]. Consequently, the U.S. exhibits slower\ndiffusion and a lower effective productivity gain, and\nthus we set:\nkus = 0.30.\n(17)\n(b) Inflection Point (t0)\nIn China, DeepSeek was officially released on Jan-\nuary 20, 2025, and rapidly gained traction in the AI\ndomain.\nThe platform reached 100 million users\nwithin seven days, and by February 2025, the num-\nber of generative AI users in China had reached\n250 million. Hence, the technological development\ninflection point for China is set as:\nt0,cn = 5.\n(18)\nIn the United States, a key milestone for generative\nAI advancement was the launch of ChatGPT in late\n2022, which markedly improved accessibility and us-\nability for text-based tasks. The subsequent release\nof GPT-4 in March 2023 represented another major\nleap in AI capability. Therefore, we define the U.S.\ninflection point as:\nt0,us = 3.\n(19)\n(9) Network Effect Coefficient (η)\nThe maximum amplification coefficient of network ef-\nfects η is derived from empirical research on the LinkedIn\nplatform. The regression results indicate that under dif-\nferent income dimensions, the coefficient corresponding\nto Metcalfe’s law ranges between 0.064 and 0.077 [28],\nimplying that when user penetration approaches 100%,\nnetwork effects can generate approximately 6%–8% ad-\nditional value.\nBased on these empirical findings, the\nbenchmark setting is:\nη = 0.07.\n(20)\n(10) Number of AI Agents (A(t))\nFollowing the model assumption of linear growth, the\nnumber of AI agents over time is defined as:\nA(t) = A0 + gt,\n(21)\nwhere A0 denotes the initial number of AI agents, and g\nrepresents the annual growth rate of AI agents.\n(11) Initial Number of AI Agents (A0)\nAs of June 2024, the number of generative AI users in\nChina reached 230 million [29]. According to a survey,\nabout 65% indicated that their organizations regularly\nused generative AI in at least one business function [30].\nThus, the estimated number of users actively employing\ngenerative AI for collaborative work is:\n2.3 × 108 × 65% = 1.495 × 108.\n(22)\nTherefore, the initial AI agent quantity in China is set as:\nA0,cn = 1.495 × 108.\n(23)\nAccording to the National Bureau of Economic Research\n(NBER), approximately 28% of U.S. employees have\nused generative AI in their work [31]. Hence, the initial\nAI agent quantity in the United States is:\nA0,us = 1.59 × 108 × 0.28 = 4.45 × 107.\n(24)\n(12) Annual Growth of AI Agents (g)\nAccording to public reports, the annual increase in the\nnumber of domestic AI agents exceeds 10 million, which\nis approximately 85 times the number of new applications\nadded annually to the Apple App Store. This figure pro-\nvides a realistic reference for determining the growth rate\nparameter g.\nConsidering that not all AI agents can be effectively\ntransformed into productive collaborative units, this study\nsets the feasible range of g between 3 million and 10 mil-\nlion agents per year. In the baseline scenario, we define:\ngcn = 5 × 106.\n(25)\nAssuming that the United States maintains the same rel-\native growth rate as China, we have:\nrcn =\ngcn\nA0,cn\n≈\n5.0 × 106\n1.495 × 108 ≈3.34%.\n(26)\nThus, for the United States:\ngus = rcn×A0,us ≈0.0334×4.45×107 ≈1.486×106.\n(27)\n(13) AI Resource Share (ω)\nThe parameter ω measures the proportion of AI-related\ncapital (including algorithms, computational power, and\ndata infrastructure) within the total national production\nresources, which encompass human capital, physical cap-\nital, and AI capital.\nAccording to the World Economic Forum (WEF), ap-\nproximately 22% of current work tasks are primarily\nperformed by machines or algorithms [32], providing an\nupper bound for the substitution effect of AI on human\nlabor. However, when AI is viewed as a capital input\nrather than direct labor replacement, its overall share in\ntotal production resources remains relatively low.\nMoreover, China exhibits a higher adoption rate of gen-\nerative AI than the United States (approximately 83% vs.\n65%), while the U.S. leads in application maturity (24%\nvs. 19%) [4]. This implies that China’s AI usage is more\nwidespread but at an earlier stage of automation, whereas\nthe U.S. demonstrates deeper and more mature integra-\ntion.\nTherefore, we set:\nωcn = 0.05,\nωus = 0.15,\n(28)\nreflecting China’s broader yet less automated AI adoption\nand the United States’ higher technological maturity.\n(14) Baseline Efficiencies (ϕ0, ϕH, and ϕA)\nWe employ a calibration method to determine the base-\nline efficiency levels for each country under conditions\nwith and without AI participation.\nIn 2010, China’s GDP was USD 6.19 trillion, and the\nUnited States’ GDP was USD 15.05 trillion. By 2019,\nChina’s GDP had risen to USD 14.58 trillion [33], while\nthat of the United States reached USD 21.54 trillion [34].\nTherefore, we define:\nY2010,cn = 6.19 × 1012,\nY2010,us = 15.05 × 1012,\nY2019,cn = 14.58 × 1012,\nY2019,us = 21.54 × 1012.\n(29)\nUsing the 2010 values of Y2010, N, and R, we can solve\nfor the baseline human efficiency:\nϕ0 = ϕH =\nY2010\nN αR1−α\n2010\n.\n(30)\nThis yields approximately:\nϕH,cn ≈90,\nϕH,us ≈532.\n(31)\nGiven these baseline human efficiencies, we can decom-\npose the total 2019 output into human and AI contribu-\ntions (assuming ω = 0.1, st = 0.5, δ = 0.2, and A(t) =\n108):\nYH = ϕHN α [(1 −ω)R2019]1−α ,\nYA = Y2019 −YH.\n(32)\nThe baseline AI efficiency can then be back-calculated as:\nϕA =\nYA\nAα [ωR2019(1 + δs)]1−α .\n(33)\nThe resulting AI baseline efficiencies are:\nϕA,cn ≈483,\nϕA,us ≈688.\n(34)\n4.2. Baseline Scenario: Pure Human Collaboration be-\ntween China and the United States\nIn the baseline model without AI participation, the total so-\ncial output of China and the United States depends entirely\non their respective endowments of human and material re-\nsources. As shown in Figure 1, based on the calibrated param-\neters, the total social outputs of China and the United States\nare 9.031 × 1012 and 15.911 × 1012, respectively, with an\noutput ratio of approximately 1 : 1.75. This result indicates\nthat although the United States does not possess an advantage\nin total resource quantity, its substantially higher per-capita\nproductivity constitutes the fundamental reason for its signif-\nicantly greater aggregate output.\nFig. 1. Model 1: Comparison of outputs between China and\nthe United States under pure human collaboration scenario\n4.3. Collaboration Model with AI Agents\nModel 2 introduces AI agents as collaborators working along-\nside humans in the production process. In this model, the in-\nclusion of AI consumes a portion of the total resources, but\nit also enhances human labor efficiency, thereby increasing\noverall output.\nFigure 2 illustrates the time evolution of the output mul-\ntiplier of China and the United States relative to the baseline\nmodel (Model 1). The results show that the output multipliers\nof both countries increase over time and eventually converge\nto a steady state, confirming that AI-driven productivity gains\nexhibit a developmental phase followed by a saturation pe-\nriod.\nHowever, the U.S. growth curve (orange) consistently\nremains above that of China (blue) throughout the entire time\nhorizon. This persistent gap suggests that the United States,\nowing to its initial advantages in AI technology deploy-\nment (such as more advanced computational infrastructure)\nand higher collaboration efficiency, is able to translate AI-\ninduced productivity gains into economic output earlier and\nmore effectively.\nFig. 2. Model 2: Comparison of output multipliers between\nChina and the United States under the AI collaboration sce-\nnario\n4.4. AI Collaboration Model with Network Effects\nBuilding upon the AI collaboration framework, Model 3 fur-\nther incorporates the network externalities among AI agents.\nThe core mechanism of this model is that as the number of AI\nagents grows linearly, their penetration rate p increases over\ntime, which in turn amplifies total output through a network\neffect multiplier defined as Θ(p) = 1 + η · p2.\nWe simulate both national scenarios under a network\nintensity parameter of η = 0.04.\nFigure 3 illustrates the\nmarginal enhancement effect of network externalities on total\nsocial output for China (blue line) and the United States (or-\nange line). As shown, under the same network effect setting,\nthe total output in both countries rises steadily over time,\nindicating that the growth of AI agents and the increase in\npenetration rate continuously strengthen productivity gains\nderived from network externalities.\nHowever, compared with the baseline scenario, the en-\nhancement effect in the United States remains significantly\nhigher than that of China throughout the entire simulation pe-\nriod, and the gap between the two continues to widen: the\ninitial improvement is approximately 0.31% for the United\nStates versus 0.15% for China, which expands to about 0.87%\nversus 0.42% by the end of the period. This widening diver-\ngence is fundamentally driven by differences in the growth\ntrajectories of AI penetration (p) between the two countries,\nsuggesting that a higher initial penetration rate or a faster dif-\nfusion speed can generate a more pronounced competitive ad-\nvantage under network effects.\nFig. 3. Model 3: Comparison of marginal enhancement ef-\nfects on total social output between China and the United\nStates under network-effect AI collaboration\n4.5. AI as an Independent Productive Entity\nModel 4 explores another scenario in which AI is endowed\nwith independent production capabilities, allowing it to share\nresources with humans and generate output autonomously.\nThis model corresponds to a highly automated economic\nstructure, where AI no longer merely assists humans but can\nindependently accomplish a portion of productive tasks.\nFigure 4 compares the total social output trajectories of\nChina and the United States under the same AI resource share\n(ω = 0.15) for Model 2 (AI collaboration) and Model 4 (AI\nindependent production).\nThe results indicate that the ab-\nsolute output level of the United States remains consistently\nhigher than that of China in both models. However, a note-\nworthy observation is that in Model 4, China’s output curve\nexhibits a significantly steeper slope, demonstrating a strong\nupward trend. This suggests that in a scenario where AI func-\ntions as an independent productive agent, China could lever-\nage the rapid expansion and diffusion of its AI agents to off-\nset its initial efficiency disadvantage, thereby gradually nar-\nrowing—and potentially surpassing—the output gap with the\nUnited States over the medium to long term.\nFurther comparison between the two models reveals that\nthe productivity gains in Model 2 are relatively limited: the\noutput curves of both countries eventually plateau, as growth\nprimarily depends on AI’s enhancement of human labor ef-\nficiency. This dynamic enables the United States, with its\nhigher baseline productivity and more mature enterprise-level\nAI application ecosystem, to maintain its dominant position.\nIn contrast, Model 4 allows for sustained marginal output\ngrowth through the endogenous expansion of both the num-\nber and capabilities of AI agents. It is precisely through this\nmechanism that China has the potential to progressively close\nthe output gap with the United States.\nFig. 4.\nComparison of total social output between China\nand the United States under Model 2 (AI collaboration) and\nModel 4 (AI independent production) with identical AI re-\nsource share (ω = 0.15)\n4.6. Comprehensive Model: AI as an Independent Pro-\nductive Entity with Network Effects\nModel 5 integrates both independent AI production and net-\nwork externalities. The simulation results (Figure 5) compare\nthe relative enhancement of total social output for China and\nthe United States under this comprehensive framework.\nThe results show that the relative improvement in the\nUnited States remains consistently higher than that in China\nthroughout the entire simulation period. Specifically, at the\ninitial time point, the network effect contributes approx-\nimately a 0.13% increase in social output for the United\nStates, compared to 0.10% for China. After twenty years, the\nimprovement in the United States rises to about 0.44%, while\nthat in China reaches 0.33%. This persistent gap primarily\nstems from differences in the initial number and growth rate\nof AI agents, as well as variations in the share of AI-related\nresources.\nAlthough the initial scale of AI agents in the United States\nis smaller than that of China, its higher AI resource share and\nmore mature application ecosystem accelerate the marginal\ndiffusion of network effects, thereby generating stronger out-\nput gains and reinforcing its productivity advantage.\nFig. 5. Model 5: Comparison of network-effect-induced out-\nput enhancement between China and the United States under\nthe comprehensive model\n5. DISCUSSION\nSignificant differences exist between the development trajec-\ntories of artificial intelligence in China and the United States.\nChina exhibits a clear trend of “accelerated advancement” in\nseveral key parameters, providing potential for technological\ncatch-up and even partial overtaking. Based on the frame-\nwork of Model 4, this section focuses on identifying which\nparameters demonstrate acceleration potential for China.\n5.1. Number of AI Agents\nSince there is currently no standardized international metric\nfor quantifying software-based AI agents, this study adopts\nthe number of physical AI agents—that is, the number of in-\ndustrial robots installed annually—as a proxy variable. An\nindustrial robot is defined as “an automatically controlled, re-\nprogrammable, multipurpose manipulator programmable in\nthree or more axes, which may be either fixed in place or mo-\nbile, and is applied in industrial automation scenarios.”\nUsing data from 2014 to 2023, we fit a quadratic growth\nmodel to the number of AI agents in China and the United\nStates, expressed as:\nA(t) = A0 + gt + 1\n2at2.\n(35)\nThe fitted results are shown in Figure 6. For China, the esti-\nmated model is:\nAcn(t) = 56,612 + 16,674t + 1,088t2,\n(36)\nwhere the positive quadratic coefficient (a = 1,088) indicates\na pronounced acceleration effect in the growth trend. For the\nUnited States, the fitted model is:\nAus(t) = 26,648 + 2,416t −140t2,\n(37)\nwhere the negative quadratic coefficient (a = −140) suggests\na deceleration trend, with growth momentum gradually weak-\nening over time.\nFig. 6. Fitted growth curves of AI agent quantities in China\nand the United States (2014–2023)\nThese results demonstrate that, in terms of AI agent quan-\ntity, China not only leads in total scale but also exhibits a\nsustained capacity for accelerated growth. In contrast, the\nUnited States experienced a slowdown after reaching a stage\npeak around 2018. Based on this evidence, we assume that\nwith effective policy intervention, China’s annual growth in\nAI agents can maintain a relatively high rate.\nTo reflect the gradual increase in the annual number of\nnew AI agents, the growth rate of China’s AI agents, gcn(t),\nis set as an increasing function of time in the simulation.\nThe baseline initial value is set to gcn(0) = 5 × 106, con-\nsistent with the previous benchmark. Considering the strong\nacceleration in industrial robot installations between 2014 and\n2023 and the continued expansion of generative AI appli-\ncations, computational power, and data infrastructure there-\nafter, we introduce a robust acceleration path under ceteris\nparibus conditions: gcn(t) increases by 20% relative to the\nbaseline by the end of the 20-year simulation period, that is,\ngcn(19) = 6 × 106. The baseline scenario follows a linear\nacceleration form:\ngCN(t) = 5 × 106 + 5 × 104t.\n(38)\nThe simulation results are shown in Figure 7. It can be\nobserved that the increase in AI agent quantity significantly\nexpands the scale of AI applications, ultimately contributing\nto overall economic output growth.\n5.2. AI Capability Level\nAccording to the Stanford AI Index Report 2025 [8], the gap\nin artificial intelligence development between China and the\nUnited States is rapidly narrowing. On the LMSYS Chat-\nbot Arena platform, the performance advantage of the best\nU.S. model over the best Chinese model was 9.3% in January\n2024, but by February 2025, this gap had shrunk to only 1.7%.\nFig. 7. Comparison of total output under adjusted AI agent\ngrowth rate (g)\nIn 2023, leading U.S. models maintained a considerable ad-\nvantage over their primary Chinese counterparts, but by early\n2025, this advantage had almost disappeared.\nSpecifically, in authoritative benchmark evaluations such\nas MMLU, MMMU, MATH, and HumanEval, the perfor-\nmance differences between Chinese and U.S. models nar-\nrowed sharply from 17.5%, 13.5%, 24.3%, and 31.6% at the\nend of 2023 to 0.3%, 8.1%, 1.6%, and 3.7% by the end of\n2024. In the large language model competition landscape, the\nperformance gap between Chinese and U.S. models has now\nfallen within a 30-point margin.\nFig. 8. Performance comparison between U.S. and Chinese\nmodels on the LMSYS Chatbot Arena platform\nTo quantitatively represent China’s convergence trend in\nAI capability, this study models China’s AI efficiency param-\neter ϕA,cn(t) as a time-dependent function, while the U.S. AI\nefficiency parameter ϕA,us(t) remains constant at 688. The\nChinese AI efficiency parameter is determined by the relative\nperformance gap ∆(t) between the two countries:\nϕA,cn(t) =\nϕA,us\n1 + ∆(t),\n(39)\nwhere ∆(t) denotes the relative performance lead of U.S.\nmodels over Chinese models at time t (measured in years\nsince the beginning of 2019).\nBased on benchmark results reported in the Stanford AI\nIndex Report 2025, the average performance gap between\nChinese and U.S. models on the MMLU, MMMU, MATH,\nand HumanEval tests was 21.7% at the end of 2023, corre-\nsponding to ϕA,cn(2023) = 565; by the end of 2024, the gap\nnarrowed to 3.4%, yielding ϕA,cn(2024) = 665. By fitting\nthese data, the performance gap function can be expressed as:\n∆(t) = ∆0 exp\n\u0012\n−t\nτ\n\u0013β\n,\nwhere τ = 4.27, β = 5.89.\n(40)\nFig. 9.\nFitted curve of China’s AI efficiency parameter\nϕA,cn(t)\nUnder this parameter setting, the simulation results indi-\ncate that China’s total social output increases substantially,\nas shown in Figure 10. The improvement reflects the com-\npounded impact of AI capability enhancement and productiv-\nity diffusion over time.\nFig. 10. Comparison of total social output after adjusting AI\ncapability parameter ϕA\n5.3. Comprehensive Adjustment\nThe preceding analyses indicate that increasing the number\n(scale) of AI agents and enhancing the level (technology) of\nAI capability are the two key pathways driving output growth.\nThis subsection integrates both dimensions to examine their\ncombined effects. Simulation results show that when both the\nAI agent growth rate and the AI efficiency parameter are si-\nmultaneously adjusted, the resulting synergistic effect is sub-\nstantially greater than in scenarios involving a single policy\nadjustment.\nAs illustrated in Figure 11, under this comprehensive\nscenario, China’s total social output increases far more sig-\nnificantly than in either of the single-adjustment cases—\nnamely, adjusting only the AI agent growth rate (Figure 7) or\nonly the AI efficiency parameter (Figure 10). This confirms\nthe existence of a resonance effect between application scale\nand technological efficiency: a larger deployment scale of AI\nagents provides a broader environment for the application of\nadvanced technologies, while higher technical efficiency en-\nhances the marginal return of each AI agent input. Together,\nthese two mechanisms reinforce each other, substantially\naccelerating China’s catch-up momentum and significantly\nreshaping the comparative output landscape between China\nand the United States.\nFig. 11. Comparison of total social output after simultaneous\nadjustment of AI agent quantity and AI capability level\n6. CONCLUSION\nBuilding upon a multilayered agent-based economic model\ndeveloped in prior research, this paper systematically simu-\nlates and compares the dynamic impacts of artificial intelli-\ngence (AI) diffusion on the economic growth structures of\nChina and the United States. From the perspectives of re-\nsource allocation, AI collaboration, network effects, and ag-\ngregate social output, our study reveals a general pattern of\n“U.S. leading and China accelerating.” China’s catch-up po-\ntential is primarily rooted in its accelerating trends of AI agent\nexpansion and capability evolution.\n6.1. Key Findings\nModel results demonstrate that the United States, leveraging\nits first-mover advantages in computing infrastructure, tech-\nnological maturity, and enterprise-level ecosystems, main-\ntains a stable lead in output when AI functions as a “collab-\norative enhancement tool” (Models 2 and 3). Its develop-\nmental trajectory is characterized by a technology-driven and\nefficiency-oriented pattern.\nHowever, as AI evolves into an “independent productive\nentity” (Models 4 and 5), the dominant drivers of growth shift\nfrom technological efficiency to the number of AI agents and\ntheir capability level. Simulation results show that China pos-\nsesses remarkable potential in both aspects: its AI agent pop-\nulation continues to expand rapidly, and its technological ca-\npability is improving swiftly. The combined effects of these\ntwo dimensions generate substantial scale and synergy gains.\nThis implies that, in the medium to long term, China may\ngradually narrow its output gap with the United States— and\nunder certain conditions, even surpass it— through a dual-\npath strategy of scale expansion and capability catch-up.\n6.2. Strategic Implications\nThe findings of this study offer clear strategic implications.\nFor the United States, sustaining its efficiency advantage in\ncore technologies is essential for maintaining its lead. For\nChina, the strategic priority should center on a dual-engine\napproach. On one hand, large-scale deployment of AI agents\nand their cross-industry integration should be leveraged to\nstrengthen network effects and industrial connectivity. On the\nother hand, greater investment in research and development\nis needed to overcome algorithmic and computational bottle-\nnecks, enabling a transition from application-driven growth\nto technology-led development.\nThrough this dual-engine\nstrategy, China can transform its breadth of application sce-\nnarios into endogenous growth depth and build a sustainable,\nintelligent economic system.\n6.3. Limitations and Future Directions\nThe conclusions of this study are based on model design and\nparameter assumptions.\nAlthough historical data fitting is\nused to enhance reliability, real-world dynamics—such as\ntechnological breakthroughs, industrial policies, and geopo-\nlitical environments— remain highly uncertain. Future re-\nsearch can be extended in several directions. First, refining\nthe classification of AI agents to incorporate general-purpose\nfoundation models, domain-specific AI, and embodied in-\ntelligence within a unified analytical framework.\nSecond,\nintegrating multi-country technology diffusion and policy\nresponse mechanisms to capture the global dynamics of AI-\ndriven growth. Third, combining empirical data to validate\nthe marginal contributions of different mechanisms within\nreal economic systems, thereby constructing a more explana-\ntory and predictive dynamic modeling framework.\n7.

    "content": "# Interpretation of the Paper: \"AI-Driven Modeling of Production and Competitiveness: A Multi-Agent Economic Simulation of China and the United States\"\n\n## 1. Core Content and Main Contributions\n\n### Core Content\nThis paper constructs a **multi-level intelligent agent economic model**, systematically simulating and comparing the macroeconomic impacts of artificial intelligence (AI) on China and the United States through five progressively expanded modeling frameworks. The study focuses on three key mechanisms:\n- **AI-augmented collaboration**: AI acts as a collaborative tool enhancing human labor productivity;\n- **Network effects**: Positive externalities arising from the growing number of AI agents;\n- **AI autonomous production**: AI becoming independent productive entities that directly contribute to output.\n\nAfter calibrating parameters using historical data, the simulation reveals two distinct development patterns: the U.S., leveraging its technological first-mover advantage, leads in the \"AI-assisted\" phase; while China, due to its vast application scale and rapid technology catch-up, demonstrates strong potential for accelerated convergence in the \"AI-independent production\" scenario.\n\n### Key Contributions\n1. **Proposing a unified modeling framework**  \n   This is the first study to integrate AI collaboration, network effects, and autonomous production into a single quantifiable multi-agent economic model, filling a critical gap in existing literature lacking systematic cross-national comparisons.\n\n2. **Quantifying structural differences between China and the U.S.**  \n   By incorporating multidimensional parameters such as population, capital, AI penetration rate, and technological capability, the model simulates long-term economic growth trajectories under different development paths.\n\n3. **Revealing dynamic shifts in competitive landscapes**  \n   The research finds that as AI evolves from an \"assistant\" to an \"independent producer,\" competitive advantage may shift from technological depth to scale and speed—offering China a strategic opportunity for breakthroughs.\n\n4. **Providing quantitative support for policymaking**  \n   Identifies key levers influencing AI-driven economic performance (e.g., growth rate of AI agents, resource allocation ratios), enabling targeted policy design.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Breakthroughs and Innovations\n\n### (1) Theoretical Modeling Innovations\n- **Introducing AI as an Independent Factor of Production**  \n  Traditional AI economics typically treats AI as a complement to capital or labor. This paper explicitly models AI as an **independent productive entity coequal with humans** in Models 4 and 5, complete with dedicated resource inputs and production functions—breaking new ground beyond conventional growth models.\n\n- **Incorporating Nonlinear Network Effects**  \n  Drawing on Metcalfe’s Law, the paper proposes a quadratic relationship for network effects among AI agents: $\\left(1 + \\eta \\left(\\frac{A(t)}{N}\\right)^2\\right)$, capturing exponential value gains from interconnectivity and significantly improving the model's explanatory power for platform-based AI ecosystems.\n\n- **Designing a Five-Tier Progressive Model Structure**  \n  The framework progresses from pure human collaboration → AI-augmented work → addition of network effects → AI autonomous production → integrated synthesis. This stepwise structure enables clear identification of each mechanism’s marginal contribution.\n\n### (2) Rigor in Empirical Design and Parameterization\n- **Multi-source calibration based on real-world data**: Utilizes datasets from Stanford’s AI Index, McKinsey reports, and China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology to ensure realistic input parameters.\n- **Dynamically evolving parameters reflecting tech trends**: For example, S-curves model AI capability growth, and time-dependent convergence functions reflect narrowing performance gaps between Chinese and American large models.\n- **Using industrial robot installations as a proxy for AI agent count**: Addresses the difficulty of measuring software-based AI agents, enhancing empirical feasibility.\n\n### (3) Strategic Foresight and Policy Implications\n- Proposes a \"**U.S. leads early, China accelerates later**\" development trajectory, arguing that China can achieve mid-term overtaking via a \"**dual-engine strategy**\" of scale expansion and technological catch-up—challenging traditional views that equate superiority solely with technological lead.\n- First-ever quantitative validation: when AI becomes an independent producer, **initial efficiency disadvantages can be overcome—or even reversed—through faster deployment speed and larger scale**, offering theoretical confidence to latecomer nations.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Viable Startup Project Recommendations\n\nBuilding on the paper’s central insight—that **large-scale AI deployment and network effects will be pivotal to future competitiveness**—here are several high-potential entrepreneurial directions:\n\n### 🚀 Startup Project One: **Cross-Industry AI Agent Orchestration Platform (\"Agent Orchestrator\")**\n\n#### Concept\nDevelop a general-purpose AI agent orchestration engine that allows enterprises to connect disparate AI tools (customer service bots, coding assistants, financial audit agents, etc.) into a unified “intelligent collaboration network,” enabling automated task routing, knowledge sharing, and joint decision-making.\n\n#### Why It Works?\n- The paper shows: **network effects grow quadratically with AI agent density** → more interconnected AI agents yield exponentially higher system value.\n- Current enterprise AI adoption is fragmented and siloed → significant unmet demand for integration.\n- In China, 83% of companies already use generative AI (vs. 65% in the U.S.), but only 19% have achieved deep implementation → precisely at the tipping point from isolated applications to systemic integration.\n\n#### Business Model\n- SaaS subscription: charged per number of connected AI agents;\n- Value-added services: pre-built automation templates, performance dashboards;\n- Ecosystem revenue share: open API marketplace where third-party developers offer specialized agent modules.\n\n#### Technical Barriers\n- Standardized multi-agent communication protocols;\n- Task decomposition and priority scheduling algorithms;\n- Security isolation and access control systems.\n\n> ✅ **Alignment**: Directly amplifies the \"network effect\" emphasized in the paper, helping businesses unlock synergistic benefits from AI clusters.\n\n---\n\n### 🏭 Startup Project Two: **\"Lightweight AI Factory\" Solutions for SME Manufacturers**\n\n#### Concept\nLeveraging China’s dominance in industrial robotics (52% of global installations), launch a low-cost, easy-to-deploy \"AI Factory Kit\" comprising pre-trained industry models, edge computing boxes, and intuitive visual interfaces—enabling small and medium manufacturers to rapidly automate quality inspection, production scheduling, and maintenance without in-house R&D.\n\n#### Why It Works?\n- The paper highlights: China leads in breadth of AI application → ideal conditions for industrial deployment;\n- SMEs lack computing power and talent → need turnkey AI solutions;\n- Government policies promote \"smart transformation and digital transition\" → opportunities for subsidized rollout via local partnerships.\n\n#### Core Features\n- Modular AI components: plug-and-play functions like visual inspection, energy optimization, and predictive maintenance;\n- On-premise deployment: ensures data privacy and compatibility with factory networks;\n- Self-learning mechanisms: continuous model improvement via operational data feedback.\n\n#### Revenue Model\n- Bundled hardware-software sales;\n- Ongoing fees for model updates and technical support;\n- Packaging successful cases for sale to industrial parks seeking full-scale smart upgrades.\n\n> ✅ **Alignment**: Accelerates the transition from \"AI-as-assistant\" to \"AI-as-autonomous-producer\" (Model 4), leveraging China’s manufacturing base to rapidly scale up the total number of AI agents.\n\n---\n\n### 🔍 Startup Project Three: **AI Capability Evaluation and Evolution Service Platform (\"AI Benchmark-as-a-Service\")**\n\n#### Concept\nCreate a cloud platform that continuously tracks the performance of various AI models, providing enterprises with selection guidance, migration planning, and technology gap diagnostics—supplemented by value-added services like fine-tuning recommendations and curated training datasets.\n\n#### Why It Works?\n- The paper stresses: **AI capability level $s(t)$ is a critical determinant of output**;\n- The China-U.S. model performance gap is rapidly closing → Chinese firms urgently need real-time intelligence;\n- The explosion of open-source models creates choice overload → demand for expert evaluation
