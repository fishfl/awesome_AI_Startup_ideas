| 2510.11085 | 2025-10-15 | Modeling AI-Driven Production and Competitiveness A Multi-Agent Economic Simulation of China and the United States | Algorithms and Models | This article compares the macroeconomic production evolution of China and the United States under different mechanisms (AI collaboration, network effects, and AI autonomous production) through simulations. It finds that when AI acts as an independent production entity, the social output growth rate far exceeds that of traditional human labor models. China has the potential for accelerated expansion in the number of intelligent agents and technology catch-up, which may lead to technological convergence and even partial surpassing. | [site link](https://everydayai.top/adetail.html?id=2510.11085) |[Detail JSON](data/2510.11085.json) |
